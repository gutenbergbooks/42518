<p class="small">"I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void
of understanding; And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had
covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. Then I
saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction."&mdash;
<span class="smcap">Proverbs</span>
24:30-32.</p>


<p class="p2">No doubt Solomon was sometimes glad to lay aside
the robes of state, escape from the forms of court, and
go through the country unknown. On one occasion,
when he was doing so, he looked over the broken wall
of a little estate which belonged to a farmer of his
country. This estate consisted of a piece of ploughed
land and a vineyard. One glance showed him that it was
owned by a sluggard, who neglected it, for the weeds
had grown right plentifully and covered all the face of
the ground. From this Solomon gathered instruction.
Men generally learn wisdom if they have wisdom.
The artist's eye sees the beauty of the landscape because
he has beauty in his mind. "To him that hath shall
be given," and he shall have abundance, for he shall
reap a harvest even from the field that is covered with
thorns and nettles. There is a great difference between
one man and another in the use of the mind's eye. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
have a book entitled, "The Harvest of a Quiet Eye,"
and a good book it is: the harvest of a quiet eye can be
gathered from a sluggard's land as well as from a well-managed
farm. When we were boys we were taught a
little poem, called, "Eyes and no Eyes," and there was
much of truth in it, for some people have eyes and see
not, which is much the same as having no eyes; while
others have quick eyes for spying out instruction. Some
look only at the surface, while others see not only the
outside shell but the living kernel of truth which is hidden
in all outward things.</p>

<p><i>We may find instruction everywhere.</i> To a spiritual
mind nettles have their use, and weeds have their doctrine.
Are not all thorns and thistles meant to be
teachers to sinful men? Are they not brought forth of
the earth on purpose that they may show us what sin
has done, and the kind of produce that will come
when we sow the seed of rebellion against God? "I
went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of
the man void of understanding," says Solomon; "I saw,
and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received
instruction." Whatever you see, take care to consider
it well, and you will not see it in vain. You shall find
books and sermons everywhere, in the land and in the
sea, in the earth and in the skies, and you shall learn
from every living beast, and bird, and fish, and insect,
and from every useful or useless plant that springs out
of the ground.</p>

<p><i>We may also gather rare lessons from things that we do
not like.</i> I am sure that Solomon did not in the least
degree admire the thorns and the nettles that covered
the face of the vineyard, but he nevertheless found instruction
in them. Many are stung by nettles, but few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
are taught by them. Some men are hurt by briers, but
here is one who was improved by them. Wisdom hath
a way of gathering grapes of thorns and figs of nettles,
and she distils good from herbs which in themselves
are noisome and evil. Do not fret, therefore, over
thorns, but get good out of them. Do not begin stinging
yourself with nettles, grip them firmly, and then use
them for your soul's health. Trials and troubles, worries
and turmoils, little frets and little disappointments, may
all help you if you will. Like Solomon, see and consider
them well&mdash;look upon them, and receive instruction.</p>

<p>As for us, we will now, first, consider <i>Solomon's description
of a sluggard</i>: he is "a man void of understanding";
secondly, we shall notice <i>his description of the sluggard's
land</i>: "it was all grown over with thorns, and
nettles had covered the face thereof." When we have
attended to these two matters we will close by <i>endeavoring
to gather the instruction which this piece of waste ground
may yield us</i>.</p>

<p>First, think of <span class="smcap">Solomon's description of a slothful
man</span>. Solomon was a man whom none of us would
contradict, for he knew as much as all of us put together;
and besides that, he was under divine inspiration
when he wrote this Book of Proverbs. Solomon
says, a sluggard is "a man void of understanding."
The slothful does not think so; he puts his hands in his
pockets, and you would think from his important air
that he had all the Bank of England at his disposal.
You can see that he is a very wise man in his own
esteem, for he gives himself airs which are meant to
impress you with a sense of his superior abilities. How
he has come by his wisdom it would be hard to say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
He has never taken the trouble to think, and yet I dare
not say that he jumps at his conclusions, because he
never does such a thing as jump, he lies down and rolls
into a conclusion. Yet he knows everything, and has
settled all points: meditation is too hard work for him,
and learning he never could endure; but to be clever by
nature is his delight. He does not want to know more
than he knows, for he knows enough already, and yet
he knows nothing. The proverb is not complimentary
to him, but I am certain that Solomon was right when
he called him "a man void of understanding." Solomon
was rather rude according to the dainty manners of
the present times, because this gentleman had a field and
a vineyard, and as Poor Richard saith, "When I have
a horse and a cow every man biddeth me good morrow."
How can a man be void of understanding who has a
field and a vineyard? Is it not generally understood
that you must measure a man's understanding by the
amount of his ready cash? At all events you shall soon
be flattered for your attainments if you have attained
unto wealth. Such is the way of the world, but such is
not the way of Scripture. Whether he has a field and a
vineyard or not, says Solomon, if he is a sluggard he
is a fool, or if you would like to see his name written
out a little larger, he is a man empty of understanding.
Not only does he not understand anything, but he has
no understanding to understand with. He is empty-headed
if he is a sluggard. He may be called a gentleman,
he may be a landed proprietor, he may have a
vineyard and a field; but he is none the better for what
he has: nay, he is so much the worse, because he is a
man void of understanding, and is therefore unable to
make use of his property.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>I am glad to be told by Solomon so plainly that a
slothful man is void of understanding, for it is useful
information. I have met with persons who thought they
perfectly understood the doctrines of grace, who could
accurately set forth the election of the saints, the predestination
of God, the firmness of the divine decree,
the necessity of the Spirit's work, and all the glorious
doctrines of grace which build up the fabric of our faith;
but these gentlemen have inferred from these doctrines
that they have to do nothing, and thus they have become
sluggards. Do-nothingism is their creed. They will
not even urge other people to labor for the Lord, because,
say they, "God will do his own work. Salvation
is all of grace!" The notion of these sluggards is that
a man is to wait, and do nothing; he is to sit still, and
let the grass grow up to his ankles in the hope of heavenly
help. To arouse himself would be an interference
with the eternal purpose, which he regards as altogether
unwarrantable. I have known him look sour, shake his
aged head, and say hard things against earnest people
who were trying to win souls. I have known him run
down young people, and like a great steam ram, sink
them to the bottom, by calling them unsound and ignorant.
How shall we survive the censures of this dogmatic
person? How shall we escape from this very knowing and
very captious sluggard? Solomon hastens to the rescue
and extinguishes this gentleman by informing us that he
is void of understanding. Why, he is the standard of
orthodoxy, and he judges everybody! Yet Solomon applies
another standard to him, and says he is void of understanding.
He may know the doctrine, but he does
not understand it; or else he would know that the doctrines
of grace lead us to seek the grace of the doctrines;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and that when we see God at work we learn that he
worketh in us, not to make us go to sleep, but to will
and to do of his own good pleasure. God's predestination
of a people is his ordaining them unto good works
that they may show forth his praise. So, if you or I
shall from any doctrines, however true, draw the inference
that we are warranted in being idle and indifferent
about the things of God, we are void of understanding;
we are acting like fools; we are misusing the gospel;
we are taking what was meant for meat and turning it
into poison. The sluggard, whether he is sluggish
about his business or about his soul, is a man void of
understanding.</p>

<p>As a rule we may measure a man's understanding
by his useful activities; this is what the wise man very
plainly tells us. Certain persons call themselves "cultured,"
and yet they cultivate nothing. Modern thought,
as far as I have seen anything of its actual working, is
a bottle of smoke, out of which comes nothing solid;
yet we know men who can distinguish and divide, debate
and discuss, refine and refute, and all the while the
hemlock is growing in the furrow, and the plough is
rusting. Friend, if your knowledge, if your culture, if
your education does not lead you practically to serve
God in your day and generation, you have not learned
what Solomon calls wisdom, and you are not like the
Blessed One, who was incarnate wisdom, of whom we
read that "he went about doing good." A lazy man is
not like our Saviour, who said, "My Father worketh
hitherto, and I work." True wisdom is practical:
boastful culture vapors and theorizes. Wisdom ploughs
its field, wisdom hoes its vineyard, wisdom looks to its
crops, wisdom tries to make the best of everything;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and he who does not do so, whatever may be his knowledge
of this, of that, or of the other, is a man void of
understanding.</p>

<p>Why is he void of understanding? Is it not because
<i>he has opportunities which he does not use</i>? His day has
come, his day is going, and he lets the hours glide by to
no purpose. Let me not press too hardly upon any one,
but let me ask you all to press as hardly as you can
upon yourselves while you enquire each one of himself,
Am I employing the minutes as they fly? This man
had a vineyard, but he did not cultivate it; he had a field,
but he did not till it. Do you, brethren, use all your
opportunities? I know we each one have some power to
serve God; do we use it? If we are his children he has
not put one of us where we are of necessity useless. Somewhere
we may shine by the light which he has given us,
though that light be only a farthing candle. Are we
thus shining? Do we sow beside all waters? Do we in
the morning sow our seed, and in the evening still
stretch out our hand? for if not, we are rebuked by the
sweeping censure of Solomon, who saith that the slothful
is a "man void of understanding."</p>

<p>Having opportunities he did not use them, and
next, <i>being bound to the performance of certain duties he did
not fulfil them</i>. When God appointed that every Israelite
should have a piece of land, under that admirable system
which made every Israelite a land owner, he meant that
each man should possess his plot, not to let it lie waste,
but to cultivate it. When God put Adam in the garden
of Eden it was not that he should walk through the glades
and watch the spontaneous luxuriance of the unfallen
earth, but that he might dress it and keep it, and he
had the same end in view when he allotted each Jew his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
piece of land; he meant that the holy soil should reach
the utmost point of fertility through the labor of those
who owned it. Thus the possession of a field and a
vineyard involved responsibilities upon the sluggard
which he never fulfilled, and therefore he was void of
understanding. What is your position, dear friend?
A father? A master? A servant? A minister? A
teacher? Well, you have your farms and your vineyards
in those particular spheres; but if you do not
use those positions aright you will be void of understanding,
because you neglect the end of your existence.
You miss the high calling which your Maker has
set before you.</p>

<p>The slothful farmer was unwise in these two respects,
and in another also; <i>for he had capacities which he did not
employ</i>. He could have tilled the field and cultivated the
vineyard if he had chosen to do so. He was not a sickly
man, who was forced to keep his bed, but he was a lazy-bones
who was there of choice.</p>

<p>You are not asked to do in the service of God that
which is utterly beyond you, for it is expected of us
according to what we have and not according to what
we have not. The man of two talents is not required to
bring in the interest of five, but he is expected to bring
in the interest of two. Solomon's slothful was too idle
to attempt tasks which were quite within his power.
Many have a number of dormant faculties of which they
are scarcely aware, and many more have abilities which
they are using for themselves, and not for Him who
created them. Dear friends, if God has given us any
power to do good, pray let us do it, for this is a wicked,
weary world. We should not even cover a glow-worm's
light in such a darkness as this. We should not keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
back a syllable of divine truth in a world that is so full
of falsehood and error. However feeble our voices, let
us lift them up for the cause of truth and righteousness.
Do not let us be void of understanding, because we
have opportunities that we do not use, obligations that
we do not fulfil, and capacities which we do not exercise.</p>

<p>As for a sluggard in soul matters, he is indeed void
of understanding, for <i>he trifles with matters which demand
his most earnest heed</i>. Man, hast thou never cultivated thy
heart? Hast the ploughshare never broken up the clods
of thy soul? Has the seed of the Word never been sown
in thee? or has it taken no root? Hast thou never watered
the young plants of desire? Hast thou never sought
to pull up the weeds of sin that grow in thy heart? Art
thou still a piece of the bare common or wild heath? Poor
soul! Thou canst trim thy body, and spend many a
minute at the glass; dost thou not care for thy soul?
How long thou takest to decorate thy poor flesh, which is
but worm's meat, or would be in a minute if God took
away thy breath! And yet all the while thy soul is uncombed,
unwashed, unclad, a poor neglected thing.
Oh it should not be so. You take care of the worse
part and leave the better to perish through neglect.
This is the height of folly! He that is a sluggard as
to the vineyard of his heart is a man void of understanding.
If I must be idle, let it be seen in my field
and my garden, but not in my soul.</p>

<p>Or are you a Christian? Are you really saved, and
are you negligent in the Lord's work? Then, indeed,
whatever you may be, I cannot help saying you have too
little understanding; for surely, when a man is saved
himself, and understands the danger of other men's souls,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
he must be in earnest in trying to pluck the firebrands
from the flame. A Christian sluggard! Is there such
a being? A <i>Christian</i> man on half time? A Christian
man working not at all for his Lord; how shall I speak
of him? <i>Time</i> does not tarry, <span class="smcap">death</span> does not tarry,
HELL does not tarry; Satan is not lazy, all the powers
of darkness are busy: how is it that you and I can be
sluggish, if the Master has put us into his vineyard?
Surely we must be void of understanding if, after being
saved by the infinite love of God, we do not spend and
be spent in his service. The eternal fitness of things
demands that a saved man should be an earnest man.</p>

<p>The Christian who is slothful in his Master's service
<i>has no idea what he is losing</i>; for the very cream of religion
lies in holy consecration to God. Some people have just
enough religion to make it questionable whether they
have any or no. They have enough godliness to make
them uneasy in their ungodliness. They have washed
enough of their face to show the dirt upon the rest of it.
"I am glad," said a servant, "that my mistress takes the
sacrament, for otherwise I should not know she had any
religion at all." You smile, and well you may. It is
ridiculous that some people should have no goods in
their shop, and yet advertise their business in all the
papers; should make a show of religion, and yet have
none of the Spirit of God. I wish some professors would
do Christ the justice to say, "No, I am <i>not</i> one of his
disciples; do not think so badly of him as to imagine
that I can be one of them." We ought to be reflections
<i>of</i> Christ; but I fear many are reflections <i>upon</i> Christ.
When we see a lot of lazy servants, we are apt to think
that their master must be a very idle person himself, or
he would never put up with them. He who employs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sluggards, and is satisfied with their snail-like pace,
cannot be a very active man himself. O, let not the
world think that Christ is indifferent to human woe,
that Christ has lost his zeal, that Christ has lost his
energy: yet I fear they will say it or think it if they see
those who profess to be laborers in the vineyard of
Christ nothing better than mere sluggards. The slothful,
then, is a man void of understanding; he loses the
honor and pleasure which he would find in serving his
Master; he is a dishonor to the cause which he professes
to venerate, and he is storing up thorns for his dying
pillow. Let that stand as settled&mdash;the slothful, whether
he be a minister, deacon, or private Christian, is a man
void of understanding.</p>


<p class="p2">Now, secondly, <span class="smcap">let us look at the sluggard's land</span>:
"I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard
of the man void of understanding; And, lo, it was all
grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the
face thereof." Note, first, that <i>land will produce something</i>.
Soil which is good enough to be made into a
field and a vineyard must and will yield some fruit or
other; and so you and I, in our hearts and in the
sphere God gives us to occupy, will be sure to produce
something. We cannot live in this world as entire
blanks; we shall either do good or do evil, as sure as we
are alive. If you are idle in Christ's work, you are
active in the devil's work. The sluggard by sleeping was
doing more for the cultivation of thorns and nettles
than he could have done by any other means. As a
garden will either yield flowers or weeds, fruits or thistles,
so something either good or evil will come out of
our household, our class, or our congregation. If we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
do not produce a harvest of good wheat, by laboring for
Christ, we shall grow tares to be bound up in bundles
for the last dread burning.</p>

<p>Note again that, if it be not farmed for God, <i>the
soul will yield its natural produce</i>; and what is the natural
produce of land if left to itself? What but thorns and
nettles, or some other useless weeds? What is the
natural produce of your heart and mine? What but
sin and misery? What is the natural produce of your
children if you leave them untrained for God? What
but unholiness and vice? What is the natural produce
of this great city if we leave its streets, and lanes, and
alleys without the gospel? What but crime and infamy?
Some harvest there will be, and the sheaves will be the
natural produce of the soil, which is sin, death, and
corruption.</p>

<p>If we are slothful, <i>the natural produce of our heart
and of our sphere will be most inconvenient and unpleasant to
ourselves</i>. Nobody can sleep on thorns, or make a pillow
of nettles. No rest can come out of an idleness which
lets ill alone, and does not by God's Spirit strive to uproot
evil. While you are sleeping, Satan will be sowing.
If you withhold the seed of good, Satan will be lavish
with the seed of evil, and from that evil will come
anguish and regret for time, and it may be for eternity.
O man, the garden put into thy charge, if thou waste
thy time in slumber, will reward thee with all that is
noisome and painful. "Thorns also and thistles shall
it bring forth to thee."</p>

<p><i>In many instances there will be a great deal of this evil
produce</i>; for a field and a vineyard will yield more
thistles and nettles than a piece of ground that has never
been reclaimed. If the land is good enough for a gar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>den,
it will present its owner with a fine crop of weeds
if he only stays his hand. A choice bit of land fit for
a vineyard of red wine will render such a profusion of
nettles to the slothful that he shall rub his eyes with
surprise. The man who might do most for God, if he
were renewed, will bring forth most for Satan if he be
let alone. The very region which would have glorified
God most if the grace of God were there to convert its
inhabitants, will be that out of which the vilest enemies
of the gospel will arise. Rest assured of that; the best
will become the worst if we neglect it. Neglect is all
that is needed to produce evil. If you want to know
the way of salvation, I must take some pains to tell you;
but if you want to know the way to be lost, my reply is
easy; for it is only a matter of negligence:&mdash;"How shall
we escape if we neglect so great salvation?" If you
desire to bring forth a harvest unto God, I may need
long to instruct you in ploughing, sowing, and watering;
but if you wish your mind to be covered with Satan's
hemlock, you have only to leave the furrows of your
nature to themselves. The slothful asks for "A little
sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
sleep," and the thorns and thistles multiply beyond all
numbering, and prepare for him many a sting.</p>

<p>While we look upon the lazy man's vineyard let us
also peep into the ungodly sluggard's heart. He does
not care about repentance and faith. To think about
his soul, to be in earnest about eternity, is too much for
him. He wants to take things easy, and have a little
more folding of the arms to sleep. What is growing in
his mind and character? In some of these spiritual
sluggards you can see drunkenness, uncleanness, covetousness,
anger, and pride, and all sorts of thistles and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
nettles; or where these ranker weeds do not appear,
by reason of the restraint of pious connections, you
find other sorts of sin. The heart cannot be altogether
empty, either Christ or the devil will possess it. My
dear friend, if you are not decided for God, you cannot
be a neutral. In this war every man is for God or
for his enemy. You cannot remain like a sheet of blank
paper. The legible handwriting of Satan is upon you&mdash;can
you not see the blots? Unless Christ has written
across the page his own sweet name, the autograph of
Satan is visible. You may say, "I do not go into open
sin; I am moral," and so forth. Ah, if you would but
look, and consider, and search into your heart, you
would see that enmity to God and to his ways, and
hatred of purity, are there. You do not love God's law,
nor love his Son, nor love his gospel, you are alienated
in your heart, and there is in you all manner of evil
desires and vain thoughts, and these will flourish and
increase so long as you are a spiritual sluggard, and
leave your heart uncultivated. O, may the Spirit of
God arouse you; may you be stirred to anxious, earnest
thought, and then you will see that these rank growths
must be uprooted, and that your heart must be turned
up by the plough of conviction, and sown with the
good seed of the gospel, till a harvest rewards the great
Husbandman.</p>

<p>Friend, if you believe in Christ, I want to peep over
the hedge into <i>your heart</i> also, if you are a sluggish Christian;
for I fear that nettles and thistles are threatening
you also. Did I not hear you sing the other day&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">"'Tis a point I long to know"?</p>

<p>That point will often be raised, for doubt is a seed which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
is sure to grow in lazy men's minds. I do not remember
reading in Mr. Wesley's diary a question about his own
salvation. He was so busy in the harvest of the Master
that it did not occur to him to distrust his God. Some
Christians have little faith in consequence of their having
never sown the grain of mustard-seed which they have
received. If you do not sow your faith by using it, how
can it grow? When a man lives by faith in Christ Jesus,
and his faith exercises itself actively in the service of his
Lord, it takes root, grows upward, and become strong,
till it chokes his doubts. Some have sadly morbid
forebodings; they are discontented, fretful, selfish,
murmuring, and all because they are idle. These are
the weeds that grow in sluggards' gardens. I have
known the slothful become so peevish that nothing could
please them; the most earnest Christian could not do
right for them; the most loving Christians could not be
affectionate enough; the most active church could not
be energetic enough; they detected all sorts of wrong
where God himself saw much of the fruit of his Spirit.
This censoriousness, this contention, this perpetual
complaining is one of the nettles that are quite sure to
grow in men's gardens when they fold their arms in
sinful ease. If your heart does not yield fruit to God it
will certainly bring forth that which is mischievous in
itself, painful to you, and injurious to your fellow-men.
Often the thorns choke the good seed; but it is a very
blessed thing when the good seed comes up so thick and
fast that it chokes the thorns. God enables certain
Christians to become so fruitful in Christ that their
graces and works stand thick together, and when Satan
throws in the tares they cannot grow because there is no
room for them. The Holy Spirit by his power makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
evil to become weak in the heart, so that it no longer
keeps the upper hand. If you are slothful, friend, look
over the field of your heart, and weep at the sight.</p>

<p>May I next ask you to look into <i>your own house</i> and
home? It is a dreadful thing when a man does not cultivate
the field of his own family. I recollect in my early
days a man who used to walk out with me into the villages
when I was preaching. I was glad of his company
till I found out certain facts, and then I shook him off,
and I believe he hooked on to somebody else, for he
must needs be gadding abroad every evening of the week.
He had many children, and these grew up to be wicked
young men and women, and the reason was that the
father, while he would be at this meeting and that,
never tried to bring his own children to the Saviour.
What is the use of zeal abroad if there is neglect at
home? How sad to say, "My own vineyard have I
not kept." Have you never heard of one who said he
did not teach his children the ways of God because he
thought they were so young that it was very wrong to
prejudice them, and he had rather leave them to choose
their own religion when they grew older? One of his
boys broke his arm, and while the surgeon was setting
it the boy was swearing all the time. "Ah," said the
good doctor, "I told you what would happen. You were
afraid to prejudice your boy in the right way, but the
devil had no such qualms; he has prejudiced him the
other way, and pretty strongly too." It is our duty to
prejudice our field in favor of corn, or it will soon be covered
with thistles. Cultivate a child's heart for good,
or it will go wrong of itself, for it is already depraved by
nature. O that we were wise enough to think of this,
and leave no little one to become a prey to the destroyer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>As it is with homes, so is it with <i>schools</i>. A gentleman
who joined this church some time ago had been an
atheist for years, and in conversing with him I found that
he had been educated at one of our great public schools,
and to that fact he traced his infidelity. He said that
the boys were stowed away on Sunday in a lofty gallery
at the far end of a church, where they could scarcely
hear a word that the clergyman said, but simply sat
imprisoned in a place where it was dreadfully hot in
summer and cold in winter. On Sundays there were
prayers, and prayers, and prayers, but nothing that
ever touched his heart; until he was so sick of prayers
that he vowed if he once got out of the school he
would have done with religion. This is a sad result,
but a frequent one. You Sunday-school teachers
can make your classes so tiresome to the children
that they will hate Sunday. You can fritter away the
time in school without bringing the lads and lasses
to Christ, and so you may do more hurt than good.
I have known Christian fathers who by their severity
and want of tenderness have sown their family field
with the thorns and thistles of hatred to religion instead
of scattering the good seed of love to it. O that we
may so live among our children that they may not only
love us, but love our Father who is in heaven. May
fathers and mothers set such an example of cheerful
piety that sons and daughters shall say, "Let us tread
in our father's footsteps, for he was a happy and a
holy man. Let us follow our mother's ways, for
she was sweetness itself." If piety does not rule in
your house, when we pass by your home we shall see
disorder, disobedience, pride of dress, folly, and the
beginnings of vice. Let not your home be a slug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>gard's
field, or you will have to rue it in years to
come.</p>

<p>Let every deacon, every class-leader, and also every
minister enquire diligently into the state of the field he
has to cultivate. You see, brothers and sisters, if you
and I are set over any department of our Lord's work,
and we are not diligent in it, we shall be like barren
trees planted in an orchard, which are a loss altogether,
because they occupy the places of other trees which
might have brought forth fruit unto their owners. We
shall cumber the ground, and do damage to our Lord,
unless we render him actual service. Will you think
of this? If you could be put down as a mere cipher in
the accounts of Christ, that would be very sad; but,
brother, it cannot be so, you will cause a deficit unless
you create a gain. Oh that through the grace of God
we may be profitable to our Lord and Master! Who
among us can look upon his life-work without some
sorrow? If anything has been done aright we ascribe
it all to the grace of God; but how much there is to
weep over! How much that we would wish to amend!
Let us not spend time in idle regrets, but pray for the
Spirit of God, that in the future we may not be void of
understanding, but may know what we ought to do, and
where the strength must come from with which to do it,
and then give ourselves up to the doing of it.</p>

<p>I beg you once more to look at the great field of <i>the
world</i>. Do you see how it is overgrown with thorns
and nettles? If an angel could take a survey of the
whole race, what tears he would shed, if angels could
weep! What a tangled mass of weeds the whole earth
is! Yonder the field is scarlet with the poppy of popery,
and over the hedge it is yellow with the wild mustard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of Mahometanism. Vast regions are smothered with
the thistles of infidelity and idolatry. The world is
full of cruelty, oppression, drunkenness, rebellion, uncleanness,
misery. What the moon sees! What God's
sun sees! What scenes of horror! How far is all this
to be attributed to a neglectful church? Nearly nineteen
hundred years are gone, and the sluggard's vineyard
is but little improved! England has been touched
with the spade, but I cannot say that it has been thoroughly
weeded or ploughed yet. Across the ocean
another field equally favored knows well the ploughman,
and yet the weeds are rank. Here and there a little
good work has been done, but the vast mass of the
world still lies a moorland never broken up, a waste,
a howling wilderness. What has the church been doing
all these years? She ceased after a few centuries to be
a missionary church, and from that hour she almost
ceased to be a living church. Whenever a church does
not labor for the reclaiming of the desert, it becomes
itself a waste. You shall not find on the roll of history
that for a length of time any Christian community has
flourished after it has become negligent of the outside
world. I believe that if we are put into the Master's
vineyard, and will not take away the weeds, neither shall
the vine flourish, nor shall the corn yield its increase.
However, instead of asking what the church has been
doing for this nineteen hundred years, let us ask ourselves,
What are we going to do now? Are the missions
of the churches of Great Britain always to be such poor,
feeble things as they are? Are the best of our Christian
young men always going to stay at home? We go on
ploughing the home field a hundred times over, while
millions of acres abroad are left to the thorn and nettle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Shall it always be so? God send us more spiritual life,
and wake us up from our sluggishness, or else when the
holy watcher gives in his report, he will say, "I went by
the field of the sluggish church, and it was all grown
over with thorns and nettles, and the stone wall was
broken down, so that one could scarcely tell which was
the church and which was the world, yet still she slept,
and slept, and slept, and nothing could waken her."</p>

<p>I conclude by remarking that <span class="smcap">there must be some
lesson in all this</span>. I cannot teach it as I would, but I
want to learn it myself. I will speak it as though I
were talking to myself.</p>

<p>The first lesson is, that <i>unaided nature always will
produce thorns and nettles, and nothing else</i>. My soul, if it
were not for grace, this is all thou wouldst have produced.
Beloved, are you producing anything else? Then it is
not nature, but the grace of God that makes you produce
it. Those lips that now most charmingly sing the praises
of God would have been delighted with an idle ballad
if the grace of God had not sanctified them. Your heart,
that now cleaves to Christ, would have continued to
cling to your idols&mdash;you know what they were&mdash;if it had
not been for grace divine. And why should grace have
visited you or me&mdash;why? Echo answers, Why? What
answer can we give? "'Tis even so, Father, for so it
seemed good in thy sight." Let the recollection of what
grace has done move us to manifest the result of that
grace in our lives. Come, brothers and sisters, inasmuch
as we were aforetime rich enough in the soil of our
nature to produce so much of nettle and thistle&mdash;and
God only knows how much we did produce&mdash;let us now
pray that our lives may yield as much of good corn for
the great Husbandman. Will you serve Christ less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
than you served your lusts? Will you make less sacrifice
for Christ than you did for your sins? Some of you
were whole-hearted enough when in the service of the
evil one, will you be half-hearted in the service of God?
Shall the Holy Spirit produce less fruit in you than that
which you yielded under the spirit of evil?</p>

<p>God grant that we may not be left to prove what
nature will produce if left to itself.</p>

<p>We see here, next, <i>the little value of natural good intentions</i>;
for this man, who left his field and vineyard to be
overgrown, always meant to work hard one of these fine
days. To do him justice, we must admit that he did
not mean to sleep much longer, for he said&mdash;"Yet a little
sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
sleep." Only a little doze, and then he would tuck up
his sleeves and show his muscle. Probably the worst
people in the world are those who have the best intentions,
but never carry them out. In that way Satan lulls
many to sleep. They hear an earnest sermon; but they
do not arise and go to their Father; they only get as far
as saying, "Yes, yes, the far country is not a fit place for
me; I will not stay here long. I mean to go home by-and-by."
They said that forty years ago, but nothing
came of it. When they were quite youths they had
serious impressions, they were almost persuaded to be
Christians, and yet they are not Christians even now.
They have been slumbering forty years! Surely that is
a liberal share of sleep! They never intended to dream so
long, and now they do not mean to lie in bed much longer.
They will not turn to Christ at once, but they are resolved
to do so one day. When are you going to do it,
friend? "Before I die." Going to put it off to the last
hour or two, are you? And so, when unconscious, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
drugged to relieve pain, you will begin to think of your
soul? Is this wise? Surely you are void of understanding.
Perhaps you will die in an hour. Did you not
hear the other day of the alderman who died in his carriage?
Little must he have dreamed of that. How
would it have fared with you had you also been smitten
while riding at your ease? Have you not heard of persons
who fall dead at their work? What is to hinder
your dying with a spade in your hand? I am often
startled when I am told in the week that one whom I
saw on Sunday is dead&mdash;gone from the shop to the
judgment-seat. It is not a very long time ago since
one went out at the doorway of the Tabernacle, and fell
dead on the threshold. We have had deaths in the
house of God, unexpected deaths; and sometimes people
are hurried away unprepared who never meant to
have died unconverted, who always had from their
youth up some kind of desire to be ready, only still they
wanted a little more sleep. Oh, my hearers, take heed
of little delays, and short puttings-off. You have wasted
time enough already, come to the point at once before
the clock strikes again. May God the Holy Spirit bring
you to decision.</p>

<p>"Surely you do not object to my having a little
more sleep?" says the sluggard. "You have waked
me so soon. I only ask another little nap." "My
dear man, it is far into the morning." He answers,
"It is rather late, I know; but it will not be much later
if I take just another doze." You wake him again, and
tell him it is noon. He says, "It is the hottest part of
the day: I daresay if I had been up I should have gone
to the sofa and taken a little rest from the hot sun."
You knock at his door when it is almost evening, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
then he cries, "It is of no use to get up now, for the
day is almost over." You remind him of his overgrown
field and weedy vineyard, and he answers, "Yes,
I must get up, I know." He shakes himself and
says, "I do not think it will matter much if I wait till
the clock strikes. I will rest another minute or two."
He is glued to his bed, dead while he liveth, buried in
his laziness. If he could sleep forever he would, but
he cannot, for the judgment-day will rouse him. It is
written, "And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torment."
God grant that you spiritual sluggards may
wake before that; but you will not unless you bestir
yourselves betimes, for "now is the accepted time";
and it may be now or never. To-morrow is only to be
found in the calendar of fools; to-day is the time of the
wise man, the chosen season of our gracious God. Oh
that the Holy Spirit may lead you to seize the present
hour, that you may at once give yourselves to the Lord
by faith in Christ Jesus, and then from his vineyard&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BROKEN_FENCE" id="THE_BROKEN_FENCE">THE BROKEN FENCE.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void
of understanding; and lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had
covered the face thereof, and <i>the stone wall thereof was broken down</i>. Then I
saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it and received instruction."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Proverbs</span>
24:30-32.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">This</span> slothful man did no hurt to his fellow-men: he
was not a thief, nor a ruffian, nor a meddler in anybody
else's business. He did not trouble himself about other
men's concerns, for he did not even attend to his own&mdash;it
required too much exertion. He was not grossly
vicious; he had not energy enough to care for that. He
was one who liked to take things easily. He always let
well alone, and, for the matter of that, he let ill alone,
too, as the nettles and the thistles in his garden plainly
proved. What was the use of disturbing himself? It
would be all the same a hundred years hence; and so
he took things just as they came. He was not a bad man,
so some said of him; and yet, perhaps, it will be found
at last that there is no worse man in the world than the
man who is not good, for in some respects he is not good
enough to be bad; he has not enough force of character
about him to serve either God or Baal. He simply serves
himself, worshipping his own ease and adoring his own
comfort. Yet he always meant to be right. Dear me!
he was not going to sleep much longer, he would only
have forty winks more, and then he would be at his work,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and show you what he could do. One of these days he
meant to be thoroughly in earnest, and make up for lost
time. The time never actually came for him to begin,
but it was always coming. He always meant to repent,
but he went on in his sin. He meant to believe, but he
died an unbeliever. He meant to be a Christian, but he
lived without Christ. He halted between two opinions
because he could not trouble himself to make up his
mind; and so he perished of delay.</p>

<p>This picture of the slothful man and his garden and
field overgrown with nettles and weeds represents many
a man who has professed to be a Christian, but who has
become slothful in the things of God. Spiritual life
has withered in him. He has backslidden; he has come
down from the condition of healthy spiritual energy into
one of listlessness, and indifference to the things of
God; and while things have gone wrong within his heart,
and all sorts of mischiefs have come into him and grown
up and seeded themselves in him, mischief is also taking
place externally in his daily conduct. The stone wall
which guarded his character is broken down, and
he lies open to all evil. Upon this point we will
now meditate. "The stone wall thereof was broken
down."</p>

<p>Come, then, let us take a walk with Solomon, and
stand with him and consider and learn instruction while
we <i>look at this broken-down fence</i>. When we have examined
it, let us <i>consider the consequences of broken-down walls</i>;
and then, in the last place, let us try to <i>rouse up this sluggard
that his wall may yet be repaired</i>. If this slothful person
should be one of ourselves, may God's infinite mercy
rouse us up before this ruined wall has let in a herd of
prowling vices.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">I. First let us take a <span class="smcap">look at this broken fence</span>.</p>

<p>You will see that in the beginning it was a very good
fence, for it was a stone wall. Fields are often surrounded
with wooden palings which soon decay, or with hedges
which may very easily have gaps made in them; but
this was a stone wall. Such walls are very usual in
the East, and are also common in some of our own
counties where stone is plentiful. It was a substantial
protection to begin with, and well shut in the pretty
little estate which had fallen into such bad hands. The
man had a field for agricultural purposes, and another
strip of land for a vineyard or a garden. It was fertile
soil, for it produced thorns and nettles in abundance,
and where these flourish better things can be produced;
yet the idler took no care of his property, but
allowed the wall to get into bad repair, and in many
places to be quite broken down.</p>

<p>Let me mention some of the stone walls that men
permit to be broken down when they backslide.</p>

<p>In many cases <i>sound principles were instilled in youth</i>, but
these are forgotten. What a blessing is Christian education!
Our parents, both by persuasion and example,
taught many of us the things that are pure and honest,
and of good repute. We saw in their lives how to live.
They also opened the word of God before us, and they
taught us the ways of right both toward God and
toward men. They prayed for us, and they prayed with
us, till the things of God were placed round about us
and shut us in as with a stone wall. We have never
been able to get rid of our early impressions. Even in
times of wandering, before we knew the Lord savingly,
these things had a healthy power over us; we were
checked when we would have done evil, we were assisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
when we were struggling toward Christ. It is very
sad when people permit these first principles to be
shaken, and to be removed like stones which fall from a
boundary wall. Young persons begin at first to talk
lightly of the old-fashioned ways of their parents. By-and-by
it is not merely the old-fashionedness of the
ways, but the ways themselves that they despise. They
seek other company, and from that other company they
learn nothing but evil. They seek pleasure in places
which it horrifies their parents to think of. This leads
to worse, and if they do not bring their fathers' gray
hairs with sorrow to the grave it is no virtue of theirs.
I have known young men, who really were Christians,
sadly backslide through being induced to modify, conceal,
or alter those holy principles in which they were
trained from their mother's knee. It is a great calamity
when professedly converted men become unfixed, unstable,
and carried about with every wind of doctrine.
It shows great faultiness of mind, and unsoundness of
heart, when we can trifle with those grave and solemn
truths which have been sanctified by a mother's tears
and by a father's earnest life. "I am thy servant," said
David, "and the son of thy handmaid": he felt it to
be a high honor, and, at the same time, a sacred bond
which bound him to God, that he was the son of one who
could be called God's handmaid. Take care, you who
have had Christian training, that you do not trifle with
it. "My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake
not the law of thy mother: bind them continually
upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck."</p>

<p>Protection to character is also found in the fact that
<i>solid doctrines have been learned</i>. This is a fine stone
wall. Many among us have been taught the gospel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of the grace of God, and they have learned it well, so
that they are able to contend earnestly for the faith
once delivered to the saints. Happy are they who have
a religion that is grounded upon a clear knowledge of
eternal verities. A religion which is all excitement, and
has little instruction in it, may serve for transient use;
but for permanent life-purposes there must be a knowledge
of those great doctrines which are fundamental to
the gospel system. I tremble when I hear of a man's
giving up, one by one, the vital principles of the gospel
and boasting of his liberality. I hear him say, "These
are my views, but others have a right to their views
also." That is a very proper expression in reference to
mere "views," but we may not thus speak of <i>truth</i> itself
as revealed by God: that is one and unalterable, and
all are bound to receive it. It is not your view of truth,
for that is a dim thing; but the very truth itself which
will save you if your faith embraces it. I will readily
yield my way of stating a doctrine, but not the doctrine
itself. One man may put it in this way, and one in
another; but the truth itself must never be given up.
The spirit of the Broad School robs us of everything like
certainty. I should like to ask some great men of that
order whether they believe that anything is taught in
the Scriptures which it would be worth while for a person
to die for, and whether the martyrs were not great
fools for laying down their lives for mere opinions which
might be right or might be wrong. This Broad-churchism
is a breaking down of stone walls, and it will let
in the devil and all his crew, and do infinite harm to
the church of God, if it be not stopped. A loose state
of belief does great damage to any man's mind.</p>

<p>We are not bigots, but we should be none the worse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
if we so lived that men called us so. I met a man the
other day who was accused of bigotry, and I said, "Give
me your hand, old fellow. I like to meet with bigots now
and then, for the fine old creatures are getting scarce,
and the stuff they are made of is so good that if there
were more of it we might see a few men among us again
and fewer mollusks." Lately we have seen few men with
backbone; the most have been of the jelly-fish order.
I have lived in times in which I should have said, "Be
liberal, and shake off all narrowness": but now I am
obliged to alter my tone and cry, "Be steadfast in the
truth." The faith once delivered to the saints is now all
the more attractive to me because it is called narrow, for
I am weary of that breadth which comes of broken
hedges. There are fixed points of truth, and definite certainties
of creed, and woe to you if you allow these stone
walls to crumble down. I fear me that the slothful are a
numerous band, and that ages to come may have to deplore
the laxity which has been applauded by this negligent
generation.</p>

<p>Another fence which is too often neglected is that of
<i>godly habits which had been formed</i>: the sluggard allows
this wall to be broken down. I will mention some
valuable guards of life and character. One is the habit
of <i>secret prayer</i>. Private prayer should be regularly
offered, at least in the morning and in the evening.
We cannot do without set seasons for drawing near to
God. To look into the face of man without having first
seen the face of God is very dangerous: to go out into
the world without locking up the heart and giving God
the key is to leave it open to all sorts of spiritual vagrants.
At night, again, to go to your rest as the swine roll
into their sty, without thanking God for the mercies of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the day, is shameful. The evening sacrifice should be
devoutly offered as surely as we have enjoyed the evening
fireside: we should thus put ourselves under the
wings of the Preserver of men. It may be said, "We
can pray at all times." I know we can: but I fear that
those who do not pray at stated hours seldom pray at
all. Those who pray in season are the most likely persons
to pray at all seasons. Spiritual life does not care
for a cast-iron regulation, but since life casts itself into
some mould or other, I would have you careful of its
external habit as well as its internal power. Never
allow great gaps in the wall of your habitual private
prayer.</p>

<p>I go a step farther; I believe that there is a great
guardian power about <i>family prayer</i>, and I feel greatly
distressed because I know that very many Christian
families neglect it. Romanism, at one time, could do
nothing in England, because it could offer nothing but
the shadow of what Christian men had already in substance.
"Do you hear that bell tinkling in the morning?"
"What is that for?" "To go to church to pray." "Indeed,"
said the Puritan, "I have no need to go there to
pray. I have had my children together, and we have
read a passage of Scripture, and prayed, and sang the
praises of God, and we have a church in our house."
Ah, there goes that bell again in the evening. What is
that for? Why, it is the vesper bell. The good man
answered that he had no need to trudge a mile or two
for that, for his holy vespers had been said and sung
around his own table, of which the big Bible was the
chief ornament. They told him that there could be no
service without a priest, but he replied that every godly
man should be a priest in his own house. Thus have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the saints defied the overtures of priestcraft, and kept
the faith from generation to generation. Household
devotion and the pulpit are, under God, the stone walls
of Protestantism, and my prayer is that these may not be
broken down.</p>

<p>Another fence to protect piety is found in <i>week-night
services</i>. I notice that when people forsake week-night
meetings the power of their religion evaporates. I do
not speak of those lawfully detained to watch the
sick, and attend to farm-work and other business, or as
domestic servants and the like; there are exceptions to
all rules: but I mean those who could attend if they
had a mind to do so. When people say, "It is quite
enough for me to be wearied with the sermons of the
Sunday; I do not want to go out to prayer-meetings,
and lectures, and so forth,"&mdash;then it is clear that they
have no appetite for the word; and surely this is a bad
sign. If you have a bit of wall built to protect the Sunday
and then six times the distance left without a fence,
I believe that Satan's cattle will get in and do no end
of mischief.</p>

<p>Take care, also, of the stone wall of <i>Bible reading</i>,
and of speaking often one to another concerning the
things of God. Associate with the godly, and commune
with God, and you will thus, by the blessing of God's
Spirit, keep up a good fence against temptations, which
otherwise will get into the fields of your soul, and devour
all goodly fruits.</p>

<p>Many have found much protection for the field of
daily life in the stone wall of <i>a public profession of faith</i>.
I am speaking to you who are real believers, and I know
that you have often found it a great safeguard to be
known and recognized as a follower of Jesus. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
never regretted&mdash;and I never shall regret&mdash;the day on
which I walked to the little river Lark, in Cambridgeshire,
and was there buried with Christ in baptism. In
this I acted contrary to the opinions of all my friends
whom I respected and esteemed, but as I had read the
Greek Testament for myself, I felt bound to be immersed
upon the profession of my faith, and I was so.
By that act I said to the world, "I am dead to you,
and buried to you in Christ, and I hope henceforth to
live in newness of life." That day, by God's grace, I
imitated the tactics of the general who meant to fight
the enemy till he conquered, and therefore he burned
his boats that there might be no way of retreat. I
believe that a solemn confession of Christ before men is
as a thorn hedge to keep one within bounds, and to keep
off those who hope to draw you aside. Of course it is
nothing but a hedge, and it is of no use to fence in a field
of weeds, but when wheat is growing a hedge is of
great consequence. You who imagine that you can be
the Lord's, and yet lie open like a common, are under a
great error; you ought to be distinguished from the
world, and obey the voice which saith, "Come ye out
from among them, be ye separate." The promise of
salvation is to the man who with his heart believeth
and with his mouth confesseth. Say right boldly, "Let
others do as they will; as for me and my house, we will
serve the Lord." By this act you come out into the
king's highway, and put yourself under the protection
of the Lord of pilgrims, and he will take care of you.
Oftentimes, when otherwise you might have hesitated,
you will say, "The vows of the Lord are upon me: how
can I draw back?" I pray you, then, set up the stone
wall, and keep it up, and if it has at any corner been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
tumbled over, set it up again, and let it be seen by your
conduct and conversation that you are a follower of
Jesus, and are not ashamed to have it known.</p>

<p>Keep to your religious principles like men, and do
not turn aside for the sake of gain, or respectability.
Do not let wealth break down your wall, for I have
known some make a great gap to let their carriage go
through, and to let in wealthy worldlings for the sake of
their society. Those who forsake their principles to
please men will in the end be lightly esteemed, but
he who is faithful shall have the honor which cometh
from God. Look well to this hedge of steadfast adherence
to the faith, and you shall find a great blessing
in it.</p>

<p>There is yet another stone wall which I will mention,
namely, <i>firmness of character</i>. Our holy faith teaches
a man to be decided in the cause of Christ, and to be
resolute in getting rid of evil habits. "If thine eye
offend thee"&mdash;wear a shade? No; "pluck it out." "If
thine arm offend thee"&mdash;hang it in a sling? No; "cut
it off and cast it from thee." True religion is very
thorough in what it recommends. It says to us, "Touch
not the unclean thing." But many persons are so idle
in the ways of God that they have no mind of their own:
evil companions tempt them, and they cannot say, "No."
They need a stone wall made up of noes. Here are the
stones "no, <i>no</i>, <span class="smcap">no</span>." Dare to be singular. Resolve to
keep close to Christ. Make a stern determination to permit
nothing in your life, however gainful or pleasurable,
if it would dishonor the name of Jesus. Be dogmatically
true, obstinately holy, immovably honest, desperately
kind, fixedly upright. If God's grace sets up this
hedge around you, even Satan will feel that he cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
get in, and will complain to God "hast thou not set a
hedge about him?"</p>

<p class="p2">I have kept you long enough looking over the wall,
let me invite you in, and for a few minutes let us <span class="smcap">consider
the consequences of a broken-down fence</span>.</p>

<p>To make short work of it, first, <i>the boundary has gone</i>.
Those lines of separation which were kept up by the
good principles which were instilled in him by religious
habits, by a bold profession and by a firm resolve, have
vanished, and now the question is, "Is he a Christian,
or is he not?" The fence is so far gone that he does
not know which is his Lord's property and which remains
an open common: in fact, he does not know
whether he himself is included in the Royal domain or
left to be mere waste of the world's manor. This is for
want of keeping up the fences. If that man had lived
near to God, if he had walked in his integrity, if the
Spirit of God had richly rested on him in all holy living
and waiting upon God, he would have known where
the boundary was, and he would have seen whether his
land lay in the parish of All-saints, or in the region
called No-man's-land, or in the district where Satan is
the lord of the manor. I heard of a dear old saint the
other day who, when she was near to death, was attacked
by Satan, and, waving her finger at the enemy, in her
gentle way, she routed him by saying, "Chosen! chosen!
chosen!" She knew that she was chosen, and she remembered
the text, "The Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem
rebuke thee." When the wall stands in its integrity
all round the field, we can resist the devil by bidding
him leave the Lord's property alone. "Begone!
Look somewhere else. I belong to Christ, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
you." To do this you must mend the hedges well
so that there shall be a clear boundary line, and you
can say, "Trespassers, beware!" Do not yield an
inch to the enemy, but make the wall all the higher,
the more he seeks to enter. O that this adversary may
never find a gap to enter by!</p>

<p>Next, when the wall has fallen, <i>the protection is gone</i>.
When a man's heart has its wall broken all his thoughts
will go astray, and wander upon the mountains of vanity.
Like sheep, thoughts need careful folding, or they
will be off in no time. "I hate vain thoughts," said
David, but slothful men are sure to have plenty of them,
for there is no keeping your thoughts out of vanity unless
you stop at every gap and shut every gate. Holy
thoughts, comfortable meditations, devout longings,
and gracious communings will be off and gone if we
sluggishly allow the stone wall to get out of repair.</p>

<p>Nor is this all, for as good things go out so bad
things come in. When the wall is gone every passer-by
sees, as it were, an invitation to enter. You have set
before him an open door, and in he comes. Are there
fruits? He plucks them, of course. He walks about
as it were a public place, and he pries everywhere. Is
there any secret corner of your heart which you will keep
for Jesus? Satan or the world will walk in; and do
you wonder? Every passing goat, or roaming ox, or
stray ass visits the growing crops and spoils more than
he eats, and who can blame the creature when the gaps
are so wide? All manner of evil lust and desires, and
imaginations prey upon an unfenced soul. It is of no use
for you to say, "Lead us not into temptation." God
will hear your prayer, and he will not lead you there;
but you are leading yourself into it, you are tempting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the devil to tempt you. If you leave yourself open to
evil influences the Spirit of God will be grieved, and he
may leave you to keep the result of your folly. What
think you, friend? Had you not better attend to your
fences at once?</p>

<p>And then there is another evil, for <i>the land itself will
go away</i>. "No," say you; "how can that be?" If a
stone wall is broken down round a farm in England a
man does not thereby lose his land, but in many parts of
Palestine the land is all ups and downs on the sides of
the hills, and every bit of ground is terraced and kept
up by walls. When the walls fall the soil slips over,
terrace upon terrace, and the vines and trees go down
with it; then the rain comes and washes the soil away,
and nothing is left but barren crags which would starve
a lark. In the same manner a man may so neglect
himself, and so neglect the things of God, and become
so careless and indifferent about doctrine, and about
holy living, that his power to do good ceases, and his
mind, his heart, and his energy seem to be gone. The
prophet said, "Ephraim is a silly dove, without heart:"
there are flocks of such silly doves. The man who trifles
with religion sports with his own soul, and will soon degenerate
into so much of a trifler that he will be averse
to solemn thought, and incapable of real usefulness.
I charge you, dear friends, to be sternly true to yourselves
and to your God. Stand to your principles in
this evil and wicked day. Now, when everything seems
to be turned into marsh and mire and mud, and religious
thought appears to be silently sliding and slipping
along, descending like a stream of slime into the Dead
Sea of Unbelief&mdash;get solid walls built around your life,
around your faith, and around your character. Stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
fast, and having done all, still stand. May God the
Holy Ghost cause you to be rooted and grounded, built
up and established, fixed and confirmed, never "casting
away your confidence, which hath great recompense
of reward."</p>

<p class="p2">Lastly, I want, if I can, <span class="smcap">to wake up the sluggard</span>.
I would like to throw a handful of gravel up to his window.
It is time to get up, for the sun has drunk up all
the dew. He craves "a little more sleep." My dear
fellow, if you take a little more sleep, you will never
wake at all till you lift up your eyes in another world.
Wake at once. Leap from your bed before you are
smothered in it. Wake up! Do you not see where
you are? You have let things alone till your heart is
covered with sins like weeds. You have neglected God
and Christ till you have grown worldly, sinful, careless,
indifferent, ungodly. I mean some of you who were once
named with the sacred name. You have become like
worldlings, and are almost as far from being what you
ought to be as others who make no profession at all.
Look at yourselves and see what has come of your neglected
walls. Then look at some of your fellow-Christians,
and mark how diligent they are. Look at many
among them who are poor and illiterate, and yet they
are doing far more than you for the Lord Jesus. In
spite of your talents and opportunities, you are an unprofitable
servant, letting all things run to waste. Is it
not time that you bestirred yourself? Look, again,
at others who, like yourself, went to sleep, meaning
to wake in a little while. What has become
of them? Alas, for those who have fallen into gross
sin, and dishonored their character, and who have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
put away from the church of God; yet they only went
a little farther than you have done. Your state of heart
is much the same as theirs, and if you should be tempted
as they have been, you will probably make shipwreck
as they have done. Oh, see to it, you that slumber,
for an idle professor is ready for anything. A
slothful professor's heart is tinder for the devil's tinderbox;
does your heart thus invite the sparks of temptation?</p>

<p>Remember, lastly, the coming of the Lord Jesus
Christ. Shall he come and find you sleeping? Remember
the judgment. What will you say to excuse yourself,
for opportunities lost, time wasted, and talents
wrapped up in a napkin, when the Lord shall come?</p>

<p>As for you, my unconverted friend, if you go dreaming
through this world, without any sort of trouble,
and never look to the state of your heart at all, you will
be a lost man beyond all question. The slothful can
have no hope, for "if the righteous scarcely are saved,"
who strive to serve their Lord, where will those appear
who sleep on in defiance of the calls of God? Salvation
is wholly and alone of grace, as you well know; but
grace never works in men's minds toward slumbering
and indifference; it tends toward energy, activity, fervor,
importunity, self-sacrifice. God grant us the indwelling
of his Holy Spirit, that all things may be set
in order, sins cut up by the roots within the heart, and
the whole man protected by sanctifying grace from the
wasters which lurk around, hoping to enter where the
wall is low. O Lord, remember us in mercy, fence us
about by thy power, and keep us from the sloth which
would expose us to evil, for Jesus' sake. Amen.</p>


<h2><a name="FROST_AND_THAW" id="FROST_AND_THAW">FROST AND THAW.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. He
casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? He sendeth
out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters
flow."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> 147:16-18.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Looking</span> out of our window one morning we saw the
earth robed in a white mantle; for in a few short hours
the earth had been covered to a considerable depth with
snow. We looked out again in a few hours and saw the
fields as green as ever, and the ploughed fields as bare
as if no single flake had fallen. It is no uncommon thing
for a heavy fall of snow to be followed by a rapid thaw.</p>

<p>These interesting changes are wrought by God, not
only with a purpose toward the outward world, but
with some design toward the spiritual realm. God is
always a teacher. In every action that he performs he
is instructing his own children, and opening up to them
the road to inner mysteries. Happy are those who find
food for their heaven-born spirits, as well as for their
mental powers, in the works of the Lord's hand.</p>

<p>I shall ask your attention, first, <i>to the operations of nature
spoken of in the text</i>; and, secondly, <i>to those operations
of grace of which they are the most fitting symbols</i>.</p>

<p>I. Consider, first, <span class="smcap">the operations of nature</span>. We
shall not think a few minutes wasted if we call your attention
to the hand of God in frost and thaw, even
upon natural grounds.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Observe the <i>directness</i> of the Lord's work. I rejoice,
as I read these words, to find how present our
God is in the world. It is not written, "the laws of
nature produce snow," but "<span class="smcap">he</span> <i>giveth snow</i>," as if every
flake came directly from the palm of his hand. We are
not told that certain natural regulations form moisture
into hoarfrost; no, but as Moses took ashes of the furnace
and scattered them upon Egypt, so it is said of the
Lord "<span class="smcap">he</span> <i>scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes</i>." It is not
said that the Eternal has set the world going and by
the operation of its machinery ice is produced. Oh,
no, but every single granule of ice descending in the
hail is from God; "<span class="smcap">he</span> <i>casteth forth his ice like morsels</i>."
Even as the slinger distinctly sends the stone out of his
sling, so the path of every hailstone is marked by the
Divine power. The ice is called, you observe, <i>his</i> ice;
and in the next sentence we read of <i>his</i> cold. These
words make nature strangely magnificent. When we
look upon every hailstone as God's hail, and upon every
fragment of ice as his ice, how precious the watery diamonds
become! When we feel the cold nipping our
limbs and penetrating through every garment, it consoles
us to remember that it is <i>his</i> cold. When the
thaw comes, see how the text speaks of it:&mdash;"<i>he sendeth
out his word</i>." He does not leave it to certain forces of
nature, but like a king, "<i>He sendeth out his word and
melteth them: he causeth</i> <span class="smcap">his</span> <i>wind to blow</i>." He has a special
property in every wind; whether it comes from the
north to freeze, or from the south to melt, it is <i>his</i> wind.
Behold how in God's temple everything speaketh of his
glory. Learn to see the Lord in all scenes of the visible
universe, for truly he worketh all things.</p>

<p>This thought of the directness of the Divine opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>tions
must be carried into providence. It will greatly
comfort you if you can see God's hand in your losses
and crosses; surely you will not murmur against the
direct agency of your God. This will put an extraordinary
sweetness into daily mercies, and make the comforts
of life more comfortable still, because they are
from a Father's hand. If your table be scantily furnished
it shall suffice for your contented heart, when you
know that your Father spread it for you in wisdom and
love. This shall bless your bread and your water; this
shall make the bare walls of an ill-furnished room as
resplendent as a palace, and turn a hard bed into a
couch of down;&mdash;my Father doth it all. We see his
smile of love even when others see nothing but the black
hand of Death smiting our best beloved. We see a
Father's hand when the pestilence lays our cattle dead
upon the plain. We see God at work in mercy when
we ourselves are stretched upon the bed of languishing.
It is ever our Father's act and deed. Do not let us get
beyond this; but rather let us enlarge our view of this
truth, and remember that this is true of the little as
well as of the great. Let the lines of a true poet strike
you:&mdash;</p>

<p>2. Next, I beg you to observe, with thanksgiving,
the <i>ease</i> of Divine working. These verses read as if the
making of frost and snow were the simplest matter in
all the world. A man puts his hand into a wool-pack and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
throws out the wool; God giveth snow as easily as that:
"He giveth snow like wool." A man takes up a handful
of ashes, and throws them into the air, so that they
fall around: "He scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes."
Rime and snow are marvels of nature: those who have
observed the extraordinary beauty of the ice-crystals
have been enraptured, and yet they are easily formed
by the Lord. "He casteth forth his ice like morsels"&mdash;just
as easily as we cast crumbs of bread outside the
window to the robins during wintry days. When the
rivers are hard frozen, and the earth is held in iron
chains, then the melting of the whole&mdash;how is that
done? Not by kindling innumerable fires, nor by sending
electric shocks from huge batteries through the interior
of the earth&mdash;no; "He sendeth forth his word,
and melteth them; he causeth his wind to blow, and
the waters flow." The whole matter is accomplished
with a word and a breath. If you and I had any great
thing to do, what puffing and panting, what straining
and tugging there would be: even the great engineers,
who perform marvels by machinery, make much noise
and stir about it. It is not so with the Almighty One.
Our globe spins round in four-and-twenty hours, and
yet it does not make so much noise as a humming-top;
and yonder ponderous worlds rolling in space track
their way in silence. If I enter a factory I hear a deafening
din, or if I stand near the village mill, turned by
water dropping over a wheel, there is a never-ceasing
click-clack, or an undying hum; but God's great
wheels revolve without noise or friction: divine machinery
works smoothly. This ease is seen in providence
as well as in nature. Your heavenly Father is as
able to deliver you as he is to melt the snow, and he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
deliver you in as simple a manner if you rest upon him.
He openeth his hand, and supplies the want of every
living thing as readily as he works in nature. Mark the
ease of God's working&mdash;he does but open his hand.</p>

<p>3. Notice in the next place the <i>variety</i> of the Divine
operations in nature. When the Lord is at work with
frost as his tool he creates snow, a wonderful production,
every crystal being a marvel of art; but then he is
not content with snow&mdash;from the same water he makes
another form of beauty which we call hoarfrost, and yet
a third lustrous sparkling substance, namely glittering
ice; and all these by the one agency of cold. What a
marvellous variety the educated eye can detect in the
several forms of frozen water! The same God who solidified
the flood with cold soon melts it with warmth;
but even in thaw there is no monotony of manner: at
one time the joyous streams rush with such impetuosity
from their imprisonment that rivers are swollen
and floods cover the plain; at another time by slow degrees,
in scanty driblets, the drops regain their freedom.
The same variety is seen in every department of nature.
So in providence the Lord has a thousand forms of
frosty trials with which to try his people, and he has ten
thousand beams of mercy with which to cheer and comfort
them. He can afflict you with the snow trial, or
with the hoarfrost trial, or with the ice trial, if he will;
and anon he can with his word relax the bonds of adversity,
and that in countless ways. Whereas men are
tied to two or three methods in accomplishing their
will, God is infinite in understanding and worketh as
he wills by ways unguessed of mortal mind.</p>

<p>4. I shall ask you also to consider the works of God
in nature in their <i>swiftness</i>. It was thought a wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
thing in the days of Ahasuerus that letters were sent by
post upon swift dromedaries. In our country we
thought we had arrived at the age of miracles when the
axles of our cars glowed with speed, and now that the
telegraph is at work we stretch out our hands into infinity;
but what is our rapidity compared with that of
God's operations? Well does the text say, "He sendeth
forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
very swiftly." Forth went the word, "Open the
treasures of snow," and the flakes descended in innumerable
multitudes; and then it was said, "Let them
be closed," and not another snow-feather was seen.
Then spake the Master, "Let the south wind blow
and the snow be melted": lo, it disappeared at the
voice of his word. Believer, you cannot tell how soon
God may come to your help. "He rode upon a cherub
and did fly," says David; "yea, he did fly upon the
wings of the wind." He will come from above to rescue
his beloved. He will rend the heavens and come
down; with such speed will he descend, that he will
not stay to draw the curtains of heaven, but he will rend
them in his haste, and make the mountains to flow
down at his feet, that he may deliver those who cry
unto him in the hour of trouble. That mighty God
who can melt the ice so speedily can take to himself the
same eagle wings, and haste to your deliverance. Arise,
O God! and let thy children be helped, and that right
early.</p>

<p>5. One other thought: consider the <i>goodness</i> of God
in all the operations of nature and providence. Think
of that goodness negatively. "Who can stand before
his cold?" You cannot help thinking of the poor in a
hard winter&mdash;only a hard heart can forget them when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
you see the snow lying deep. But suppose that snow
continued to fall! What is there to hinder it? The
same God who sends us snow for one day could do the
like for fifty days if he pleased. Why not? And when
the frost pinches us so severely, why should it not be
continued month after month? We can only thank the
goodness which does not send "His cold" to such an
extent that our spirits expire. Travellers toward the
North Pole tremble as they think of this question,
"Who can stand before his cold?" For cold has a degree
of omnipotence in it when God is pleased to let it
loose. Let us thank God for the restraining mercy by
which he holds the cold in check.</p>

<p>Not only negatively, but positively there is mercy
in the snow. Is not that a suggestive metaphor? "He
giveth snow <i>like wool</i>." The snow is said to warm the
earth; it protects those little plants which have just begun
to peep above the ground, and might otherwise be
frost-bitten; as with a garment of down the snow protects
them from the extreme severity of cold. Hence
Watts sings, in his version of the hundred and forty-seventh
Psalm&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="line small">"His flakes of snow like wool he sends,</div>
<div class="line ip5 small">And thus the springing corn defends."</div>
      </div>
   </div>
</div>

<p>It was an idea of the ancients that snow warmed the
heart of the soil, and gave it fertility, and therefore
they praised God for it. Certainly there is much mercy
in the frost, for pestilence might run a far longer race
if it were not that the frost cries to it, "Hitherto shalt
thou come, but no farther." Noxious insects would
multiply until they devoured the precious fruits of the
earth, if sharp nights did not destroy millions of them,
so that these pests are swept off the earth. Though man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
may think himself a loser by the cold, he is a great ultimate
gainer by the decree of Providence which ordains
winter. The quaint saying of one of the old writers
that "snow is wool, and frost is fire, and ice is bread,
and rain is drink," is true, though it sounds like a paradox.
There is no doubt that frost in breaking up the
soil promotes fruitfulness, and so the ice becomes bread.
Thus those agencies, which for the moment deprive
our workers of their means of sustenance, are the
means by which God supplies every living thing.
Mark, then, God's goodness as clearly in the snow and
frost as in the thaw which clears the winter's work away.</p>

<p>Christian, remember the goodness of God in the frost
of adversity. Rest assured that when God is pleased to
send out the biting winds of affliction he is in them, and
he is always love, as much love in sorrow as when he
breathes upon you the soft south wind of joy. See the
lovingkindness of God in every work of his hand!
Praise him&mdash;he maketh summer and winter&mdash;let your
song go round the year! Praise him&mdash;he giveth
day and sendeth night&mdash;thank him at all hours! Cast
not away your confidence, it hath great recompense of
reward. As David wove the snow, and rain, and
stormy wind into a song, even so combine your trials,
your tribulations, your difficulties and adversities into a
sweet psalm of praise and say perpetually&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="line small">"Let us, with a gladsome mind,</div>
<div class="line ip5 small">Praise the Lord, for he is kind."</div>
      </div>
   </div>
</div>


<p>Thus much upon the operations of nature. It is a very
tempting theme, but other fields invite me.</p>

<p>II. I would address you very earnestly and solemnly
Upon <span class="smcap">those operations of grace, of which frost
and thaw are the outward symbols</span>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a period with God's own people when he
comes to deal with them by <i>the frost of the law</i>. The law
is to the soul as the cutting north wind. Faith can see
love in it, but the carnal eye of sense cannot. It is a
cold, terrible, comfortless blast. To be exposed to the
full force of the law of God would be to be frost-bitten
with everlasting destruction; and even to feel it for a
season would congeal the marrow of one's bones, and
make one's whole being stiff with affright. "Who can
stand before his cold?" When the law comes forth
thundering from its treasuries, who can stand before it?
The effect of law-work upon the soul is to bind up the
rivers of human delight. No man can rejoice when the
terrors of conscience are upon him. When the law of
God is sweeping through the soul, music and dancing
lose their joy, the bowl forgets its power to cheer, and
the enchantments of earth are broken. The rivers of
pleasure freeze to icy despondency. The buds of hope
are suddenly nipped, and the soul finds no comfort. It
was satisfied once to grow rich, but rust and canker
are now upon all gold and silver. Every promising
hope is frost-bitten, and the spirit is winter-bound in
despair. This cold makes the sinner feel how ragged
his garments are. He could strut about, when it was
summer weather, and think his rags right royal robes,
but now the cold frost finds out every rent in his garment,
and in the hands of the terrible law he shivers like
the leaves upon the aspen. The north wind of judgment
searches the man through and through. He did
not know what was in him, but now he sees his inward
parts to be filled with corruption and rottenness. These
are some of the terrors of the wintry breath of the law.</p>

<p>This frost of law and terrors only tends to harden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Nothing splits the rock or makes the cliff tumble like
frost when succeeded by thaw, but frost alone makes
the earth like a mass of iron, breaking the ploughshare
which would seek to pierce it. A sinner under the influence
of the law of God, apart from the gospel, is hardened
by despair, and cries, "There is no hope, and
therefore after my lusts will I go. Whereas there is no
heaven for me after this life, I will make a heaven out
of this earth; and since hell awaits me, I will at least
enjoy such sweets as sin may afford me here." This is
not the fault of the law; the blame lies with the corrupt
heart which is hardened by it; yet, nevertheless,
such is its effect.</p>

<p>When the Lord has wrought by the frost of the law,
he sends <i>the thaw of the gospel</i>. When the south wind
blows from the land of promise, bringing precious remembrances
of God's fatherly pity and tender lovingkindness,
then straightway the heart begins to soften
and a sense of blood-bought pardon speedily dissolves
it. The eyes fill with tears, the heart melts in tenderness,
rivers of pleasure flow freely, and buds of hope
open in the cheerful air. A heavenly spring whispers
to the flowers that were sleeping in the cold earth; they
hear its voice, and lift up their heads, for "the rain is
over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth, the
time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of
the turtle is heard in our land." God sendeth his
Word, saying, "Thy warfare is accomplished, and thy
sin is pardoned;" and when that blessedly cheering
word comes with power to the soul, and the sweet
breath of the Holy Spirit acts like the warm south wind
upon the heart, then the waters flow, and the mind is
filled with holy joy, and light, and liberty.</p>

      </div>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Having shown you that there is a parallel between
frost and thaw in nature and law and gospel in grace, I
would utter the same thoughts concerning grace which
I gave you concerning nature.</p>

<p>1. We began with the directness of God's works in
nature. Now, beloved friends, remark the <i>directness of
God's works in grace</i>. When the heart is truly affected
by the law of God, when sin is made to appear exceeding
sinful, when carnal hopes are frozen to death by the
law, when the soul is made to feel its barrenness and
utter death and ruin&mdash;this is the finger of God. Do not
speak of the minister. It was well that he preached
earnestly: God has used him as an instrument, but
God worketh all. When the thaw of grace comes, I
pray you discern the distinct hand of God in every beam
of comfort which gladdens the troubled conscience, for
it is the Lord alone who bindeth up the broken in heart
and healeth all their wounds. We are far too apt to
stop in instrumentalities. Folly makes men look to sacraments
for heart-breaking or heart-healing, but sacraments
all say, "It is not in us." Some of you look to
the preaching of the Word, and look no higher; but all
true preachers will tell you, "It is not in us." Eloquence
and earnestness at their highest pitch can neither
break nor heal a heart. This is God's work. Ay, and
not God's secondary work in the sense in which the philosopher
admits that God is in the laws of nature, but
God's personal and immediate work. He putteth forth
his own hand when the conscience is humbled, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
by his own right hand that the conscience is eased and
cleansed.</p>

<p>I desire that this thought may abide upon your
minds, for you will not praise God else, nor will you be
sound in doctrine. All departures from sound doctrine
on the point of conversion arise from forgetfulness
that it is a divine work from first to last; that the faintest
desire after Christ is as much the work of God as the
gift of his dear Son; and that our whole spiritual history
through, from the Alpha to the Omega, the Holy
Spirit works in us to will and to do of his own good
pleasure. As you have evidently seen the finger of
God in casting forth his ice and in sending thaw, so I
pray you recognize the handiwork of God in giving you
a sense of sin, and in bringing you to the Saviour's feet.
Join together in heartily praising the wonder-working
God, who doeth all things according to the counsel of
his will.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="line small i6">"Our seeking thy face</div>
<div class="line small i6p5">Was all of thy grace,</div>
<div class="line small">Thy mercy demands, and shall have all the praise:</div>
<div class="line small i6p5">No sinner can be</div>
<div class="line small i6p5">Beforehand with thee,</div>
<div class="line ip5 small">Thy grace is preventing, almighty and free."</div>
      </div>
   </div>
</div>



<p>2. The second thought upon nature was <i>the ease with
which the Lord worked</i>. There was no effort or disturbance.
Transfer that to the work of grace. How easy
it is for God to send law-work into the soul! You stubborn
sinner, <i>you</i> cannot touch him, and even providence
has failed to awaken him. He is dead&mdash;altogether dead
in trespasses and sins. But if the glorious Lord will
graciously send forth the wind of his Spirit, that will
melt him. The swearing reprobate, whose mouth is
blackened with profanity, if the Lord doth but look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
upon him and make bare his arm of irresistible grace,
shall yet praise God, and bless his name, and live to his
honor. Do not limit the Holy One of Israel. Persecuting
Saul became loving Paul, and why should not that
person be saved of whose case you almost despair?
Your husband may have many points which make his
case difficult, but no case is desperate with God. Your
son may have offended both against heaven and against
you, but God can save the most hardened. The sharpest
frost of obstinate sin must yield to the thaw of grace.
Even huge icebergs of crime must melt in the Gulf-stream
of infinite love.</p>

<p>Poor sinner, I cannot leave this point without a
word to you. Perhaps the Master has sent the frost to
you, and you think it will never end. Let me encourage
you to hope, and yet more, to pray for gracious
visitations. Miss Steele's verses will just suit your
mournful yet hopeful state.</p>

</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>It is easy for God to deliver you. He says, "I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
blotted out like a thick cloud thy transgressions." I
stood the other evening looking up at a black cloud
which was covering all the heavens, and I thought it
would surely rain; I entered the house, and when I
came out again the sky was all blue&mdash;the wind had
driven the cloud away. So may it be with your soul.
It is an easy thing for the Lord to put away sin from
repenting sinners. All obstacles which hindered our
pardon were removed by Jesus when he died upon the
tree, and if you believe in him you will find that he has
cast your sins into the depths of the sea. If thou canst
believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</p>

<p>3. The next thought concerning the Lord's work
in nature was the <i>variety</i> of it. Frost produces a sort of
trinity in unity&mdash;snow, hoarfrost, ice; and when the
thaw comes its ways are many. So it is with God in
the heart. Conviction comes not alike to all. Some
convictions fall as the snow from heaven: you never
hear the flakes descend, they alight so gently one upon
the other. There are soft-coming convictions; they
are felt, but we can scarcely tell when we began to feel
them. A true work of repentance may be of the gentlest
kind. On the other hand, the Lord casteth forth
his ice like morsels, the hailstones rattle against the
window, and you think they will surely force their way
into the room, and so to many persons convictions come
beating down till they remind you of hailstones. There
is variety. It is as true a frost which produces the
noiseless snow as that which brings forth the terrible
hail. Why should you want hailstones of terror? Be
thankful that God has visited you, but do not dictate
to him the way of his working.</p>

<p>With regard to the gospel thaw. If you may but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
be pardoned by Jesus, do not stipulate as to the manner
of his grace. Thaw is universal and gradual, but
its commencement is not always discernible. The
chains of winter are unloosed by degrees: the surface
ice and snow melt, and by and by the warmth permeates
the entire mass till every rock of ice gives way.
But while thaw is universal and visible in its effects you
cannot see the mighty power which is doing all this.
Even so you must not expect to discern the Spirit of
God. You will find him gradually operating upon the
entire man, enlightening the understanding, freeing the
will, delivering the heart from fear, inspiring hope,
waking up the whole spirit, gradually and universally
working upon the mind and producing the manifest effects
of comfort, and hope, and peace; but you can no
more see the Spirit of God than you can see the south
wind. The effect of his power is to be felt, and when
you feel it, do not marvel if it be somewhat different
from what others have experienced. After all, there is
a singular likeness in snow and hoarfrost and ice, and
so there is a remarkable sameness in the experience of
all God's children; but still there is a great variety in
the inward operations of divine grace.</p>

<p>4. We must next notice the <i>rapidity</i> of God's works,
"His word runneth very swiftly." It did not take
many days to get rid of the last snow. A contractor
would take many a day to cart it away, but God sendeth
forth his word, and the snow and ice disappear at
once. So is it with the soul: the Lord often works
rapidly when he cheers the heart. You may have been
a long time under the operation of his frosty law, but
there is no reason why you should be another hour
under it. If the Spirit enables you to trust in the fin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>ished
work of Christ, you may go out of this house rejoicing
that every sin is forgiven. Poor soul, do not
think that the way from the horrible pit is to climb, step
by step, to the top. Oh no; Jesus can set your feet
upon a rock ere the clock shall have gone round the
dial. He can in an instant bring you from death to life,
from condemnation to justification. "To-day shall thou
be with me in Paradise," was spoken to a dying thief,
black and defiled with sin. Only believe in the atoning
sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.</p>

<p>5. Our last thought upon the operation of God was
<i>his goodness</i> in it all. What a blessing that God did not
send us more law-work than he did! "Who can stand
before his cold?" Oh! beloved, when God has taken
away from man natural comfort, and made him feel divine
wrath in his soul, it is an awful thing. Speak of a
haunted man; no man need be haunted with a worse
ghost than the remembrance of his old sins. The childish
tale of the sailor with the old man of the mountain
on his back, who pressed him more and more heavily, is
more than realized in the history of the troubled conscience.
If one sin do but leap on a man's back, it will
sink the sinner through every standing-place that he can
possibly mount upon; he will go down, down, under its
weight, till he sinks to the lowest depths of hell. There
is no place where sin can be borne till you get upon the
Rock of Ages, and even there the joy is not that <i>you</i> bear
it, but that Jesus has borne it all for you. The spirit
would utterly fail before the law, if it had full sway.
Thank God, "he stayeth his rough wind in the day of
his east wind." At the same time, how thankful we
may be, that we ever felt the law-frost in our soul. The
folly of self-righteousness is killed by the winter of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>viction.
We should have been a thousand times more
proud, and foolish, and worldly, than we are, if it had
not been for the sharp frost with which the Lord nipped
the growths of the flesh.</p>

<p>But how shall we thank him sufficiently for the
thaw of his lovingkindness? How great the change
which his mercy made in us as soon as its beams had
reached our soul! Hardness vanished, cold departed,
warmth and love abounded, and the life-floods leaped in
their channels. The Lord visited us, and we rose from
our grave of despair, even as the seeds arise from the
earth. As the bulb of the crocus holds up its golden
cup to be filled with sunshine, so did our new-born faith
open itself to the glory of the Lord. As the primrose
peeps up from the sod to gaze upon the sun, so did our
hope look forth for the promise, and delight itself in
the Lord. Thank God that spring-tide has with many
of us matured into summer, and winter has gone never
to return. We praise the Lord for this every day of our
lives, and we will praise him when time shall be no
more in that sunny land&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CORN_OF_WHEAT_DYING_TO_BRING" id="THE_CORN_OF_WHEAT_DYING_TO_BRING">THE CORN OF WHEAT DYING TO BRING
FORTH FRUIT.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man
should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall
into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much
fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it: and he that hateth his life in this
world shall keep it unto life eternal."&mdash;<span class="smcap">John</span> 12:23-25.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Certain</span> Greeks desired to see Jesus. These were
Gentiles and it was remarkable that they should, just at
this time, have sought an interview with our Lord. I
suppose that the words "We would see Jesus" did not
merely mean that they would like to look at him, for
that they could have done in the public streets; but
they would "see" him as we speak of seeing a person
with whom we wish to hold a conversation. They desired
to be introduced to him, and to have a few words
of instruction from him.</p>

<p>These Greeks were the advanced guard of that great
multitude that no man can number, of all nations, and
people, and tongues, who are yet to come to Christ.
The Saviour would naturally feel a measure of joy at
the sight of them, but he did not say much about it, for
his mind was absorbed just then with thoughts of his
great sacrifice and its results; yet he took so much notice
of the coming of these Gentiles to him that it gave
a color to the words which are here recorded by his
servant John.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>I notice that the Saviour here <i>displays his broad humanity</i>,
and announces himself as the "Son of man." He
had done so before, but here with new intent. He says,
"The hour is come, that the Son of man should be
glorified." Not as "the Son of David" does he here
speak of himself, but as "the Son of man." No longer
does he make prominent the Jewish side of his mission,
though as a preacher he was not sent to save the lost
sheep of the house of Israel; but as the dying Saviour
he speaks of himself as one of the race, not the Son of
Abraham, or of David, but "the Son of man": as much
brother to the Gentile as to the Jew. Let us never forget
the broad humanity of the Lord Jesus. In him all
kindreds of the earth are joined in one, for he is not
ashamed to bear the nature of our universal manhood;
black and white, prince and pauper, sage and savage,
all see in his veins the one blood by which all men are
constituted one family. As the Son of man Jesus is
near akin to every man that lives.</p>

<p>Now, too, that the Greeks were come, our Lord <i>speaks
somewhat of his glory</i> as approaching. "The hour is
come," saith he, "that the Son of man should be glorified."
He does not say "that the Son of man should be
crucified," though that was true, and the crucifixion
must come before the glorification; but the sight of
those first-fruits from among the Gentiles makes him
dwell upon his glory. Though he remembers his death,
he speaks rather of the glory which would grow out of
his great sacrifice. Remember, brethren, that Christ is
glorified in the souls that he saves. As a physician wins
honor by those he heals, so the Physician of souls gets
glory out of those who come to him. When these devout
Greeks came, saying, "Sirs, we would see Jesus,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
though a mere desire to see him is only as the green
blade, yet he rejoiced in it as the pledge of the harvest,
and he saw in it the dawn of the glory of his cross.</p>

<p>I think, too, that the coming of these Greeks somewhat
<i>led the Saviour to use the metaphor of the buried corn</i>.
We are informed that wheat was largely mixed up with
Grecian mysteries, but that is of small importance. It
is more to the point that our Saviour was then undergoing
the process which would burst the Jewish husk in
which, if I may use such terms, his human life had been
enveloped. I mean this: aforetime our Lord said that
he was not sent save to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel, and when the Syrophenician woman pleaded for
her daughter he reminded her of the restricted character
of his commission as a prophet among men. When he
sent out the seventy, he bade them not to go into the
cities of the Samaritans, but to seek after the house of
Israel only. Now, however, that blessed corn of wheat
is breaking through its outer integument. Even before
it is put into the ground to die the divine corn of
wheat begins to show its living power, and the true
Christ is being manifested. The Christ of God, though
assuredly the Son of David, was, on the Father's side,
neither Jew nor Gentile, but simply man; and the
great sympathies of his heart were with all mankind.
He regarded all whom he had chosen as his own brethren
without distinction of sex, or nation, or the period
of the world's history in which they should live; and, at
the sight of these Greeks, the true Christ came forth
and manifested himself to the world as he had not
done before. Hence, perhaps, the peculiar metaphor
which we have now to explain.</p>

<p>In our text, dear friends, we have two things upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
which I will speak briefly, as I am helped of the Spirit.
First, we have <i>profound doctrinal teaching</i>, and, secondly,
we have <i>practical moral principle</i>.</p>

<p>First, we have <span class="smcap">profound doctrinal teaching</span>.</p>

<p>Our Saviour suggested to his thoughtful disciples a
number of what might be called doctrinal paradoxes.</p>

<p>First, that, <i>glorious as he was, he was yet to be glorified</i>.
"The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified."
Jesus was always glorious. It was a glorious
thing for the human person of the Son of man to be
personally one with the Godhead. Our Lord Jesus had
also great glory all the while he was on earth, in the
perfection of his moral character. The gracious end for
which he came here was real glory to him: his condescending
to be the Saviour of men was a great glorification
of his loving character. His way of going about
his work&mdash;the way in which he consecrated himself to
his Father and was always about his Father's business,
the way in which he put aside Satan with his blandishments,
and would not be bribed by all the kingdoms of
the world&mdash;all this was his glory. I should not speak
incorrectly if I were to say that Christ was really as to
his moral nature never more glorious than when throughout
his life on earth he was obscure, despised, rejected,
and yet the faithful servant of God, and the ardent
lover of the sons of men. The apostle says, "The
Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we
beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of
the Father, full of grace and truth," in which he refers
not only to the transfiguration, in which there were
special glimpses of the divine glory, but to our Lord's
tabernacling among men in the common walks of life.
Saintly, spiritual minds beheld the glory of his life, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
glory of grace and truth such as never before had been
seen in any of the sons of men. But though he was
thus, to all intents and purposes, already glorious, Jesus
had yet to be glorified. Something more was to be
added to his personal honor. Remember, then, that
when you have the clearest conceptions of your Lord,
there is still a glory to be added to all that you can see
even with the word of God in your hands. Glorious as
the living Son of man had been, there was a further
glory to come upon him through his death, his resurrection,
and his entrance within the veil. He was a glorious
Christ, and yet he had to be glorified.</p>

<p>A second paradox is this&mdash;that <i>his glory was to come
to him through shame</i>. He says, "The hour is come, that
the Son of man should be glorified," and then he speaks
of his death. The greatest fulness of our Lord's glory
arises out of his emptying himself, and becoming obedient
to death, even the death of the cross. It is his
highest reputation that he made himself of no reputation.
His crown derives new lustre from his cross;
his ever living is rendered more honorable by the fact of
his dying unto sin once. Those blessed cheeks would
never have been so fair as they are in the eyes of his
chosen if they had not once been spat upon. Those
dear eyes had never had so overpowering a glance if
they had not once been dimmed in the agonies of death
for sinners. His hands are as gold rings set with the
beryl, but their brightest adornments are the prints of
the cruel nails. As the Son of God his glory was all his
own by nature, but as Son of man his present splendor
is due to the cross, and to the ignominy which surrounded
it when he bore our sins in his own body.
We must never forget this, and if ever we are tempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to merge the crucified Saviour in the coming King we
should feel rebuked by the fact that thus we should rob
our Lord of his highest honor. Whenever you hear
men speak lightly of the atonement stand up for it at
once, for out of this comes the main glory of your Lord
and Master. They say, "Let him come down from the
cross, and we will believe on him." If he did so what
would remain to be believed? It is on the cross, it is
from the cross, it is through the cross that Jesus mounts
to his throne, and the Son of man has a special honor in
heaven to-day because he was slain and has redeemed us
to God by his blood.</p>

<p>The next paradox is this&mdash;<i>Jesus must be alone or abide
alone</i>. Notice the text as I read it: "Except a corn of
wheat fall into the ground and die," and so gets alone,
"it abideth alone." The Son of man must be alone in
the grave, or he will be alone in heaven. He must fall
into the ground like the corn of wheat, and be there in
the loneliness of death, or else he will abide alone.
This is a paradox readily enough explained; our Lord
Jesus Christ as the Son of man, unless he had trodden
the winepress alone, unless beneath the olives of Gethsemane
he had wrestled on the ground, and as it were
sunk into the ground until he died, if he had not been
there alone, and if on the cross he had not cried, "My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" so that he
felt quite deserted and alone, like the buried corn of
wheat&mdash;could not have saved us. If he had not actually
died he would as man have been alone forever: not
without the eternal Father and the divine Spirit, not
without the company of angels; but there had not been
another man to keep him company. Our Lord Jesus
cannot bear to be alone. A head without its members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
is a ghastly sight, crown it as you may. Know ye not
that the church is his body, the fulness of him that filleth
all in all? Without his people Jesus would have
been a shepherd without sheep; surely it is not a
very honorable office to be a shepherd without a flock.</p>

<p>He would have been a husband without his spouse;
but he loves his bride so well that for this purpose did
he leave his Father and become one flesh with her
whom he had chosen. He clave to her, and died for
her; and had he not done so he would have been a
bridegroom without a bride. This could never be. His
heart is not of the kind that can enjoy a selfish happiness
which is shared by none. If you have read Solomon's
Song, where the heart of the Bridegroom is revealed,
you will have seen that he desires the company of
his love, his dove, his undefiled. His delights were
with the sons of men. Simon Stylites on the top of a
pillar is not Jesus Christ; the hermit in his cave may
mean well, but he finds no warrant for his solitude in
him whose cross he professes to venerate. Jesus was
the friend of men, not avoiding them, but seeking the
lost. It was truly said of him, "This man receiveth
sinners, and eateth with them." He draws all men
unto him, and for this cause he was lifted up from the
earth. Yet must this great attractive man have been
alone in heaven if he had not been alone in Gethsemane,
alone before Pilate, alone when mocked by soldiers,
and alone upon the cross. If this precious grain
of wheat had not descended into the dread loneliness of
death it had remained alone, but since he died he
"bringeth forth much fruit."</p>

<p>This brings us to the fourth paradox&mdash;<i>Christ must die
to give life</i>. "Except a corn of wheat fall into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth
forth much fruit": Jesus must die to give life to
others. Persons who do not think confound dying with
non-existence, and living with existence&mdash;very, very
different things. "The soul that sinneth it shall die:"
it shall never go out of existence, but it shall die by
being severed from God who is its life. There are many
men who exist, and yet have not true life, and shall
not see life, but "the wrath of God abideth on them."
The grain of wheat when it is put into the ground dies;
do we mean that it ceases to be? Not at all. What is
death? It is the resolution of anything possessing life
into its primary elements. With us it is the body parting
from the soul; with a grain of wheat it is the dissolving
of the elements which made up the corn. Our
divine Lord when put into the earth did not see corruption,
but his soul was parted from his body for a while,
and thus he died; and unless he had literally and actually
died he could not have given life to any of us.</p>

<p>Beloved friends, this teaches us where the vital point
of Christianity lies, <i>Christ's death is the life of his teaching</i>.
See here: if Christ's preaching had been the essential
point, or if his example had been the vital point, he
could have brought forth fruit and multiplied Christians
by his preaching, and by his example. But he declares
that, except he shall die, he shall not bring forth
fruit. Am I told that this was because his death would
be the completion of his example, and the seal of his
preaching? I admit that it was so, but I can conceive
that if our Lord had rather continued to live on&mdash;if he
had been here constantly going up and down the world
preaching and living as he did, and if he had wrought
miracles as he did, and put forth that mysterious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
attracting power, which was always with him, he might
have produced a marvellous number of disciples. If
his teaching and living had been the way in which
spiritual life could have been bestowed, without an
atonement, why did not the Saviour prolong his life on
earth? But the fact is that no man among us can know
anything about spiritual life except through the atonement.
There is no way by which we can come to a
knowledge of God except through the precious blood
of Jesus Christ, by which we have access to the Father.
If, as some tell us, the ethical part of Christianity is
much more to be thought of than its peculiar doctrines,
then, why did Jesus die at all? The ethical might have
been brought out better by a long life of holiness. He
might have lived on till now if he had chosen, and still
have preached, and still have set an example among the
sons of men; but he assures us that only by death could
he have brought forth fruit. What, not with all that holy
living? No. What, not by that matchless teaching?
No. Not one among us could have been saved from
eternal death except an expiation had been wrought by
Jesus' sacrifice. Not one of us could have been quickened
into spiritual life except Christ himself had died
and risen from the dead.</p>

<p>Brethren, all the spiritual life that there is in the
world is the result of Christ's death. We live under a
dispensation which shadows forth this truth to us. Life
first came into the world by a creation: that was lost in
the garden. Since then, the father of our race is Noah,
and life by Noah came to us by a typical death, burial,
and resurrection. Noah went in unto the ark, and was
shut in, and so buried. In that ark Noah went among
the dead, himself enveloped in the rain and in the ark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and he came out into a new world, rising again, as it
were, when the waters were assuaged. That is the way
of life to-day. We are dead with Christ, we are buried
with Christ, we are risen with Christ; and there is no real
spiritual life in this world except that which has come
to us by the process of death, burial, and resurrection
with Christ. Do you know anything about this, dear
friends?&mdash;for if you do not, you know not the life of
God. You know the theory, but do you know the experimental
power of this within your own spirit? Whenever
we hear the doctrine of the atonement attacked,
let us stand up for it. Let us tell the world that while we
value the life of Christ even more than they do, we know
that it is not the example of Christ that saves anybody,
but his death for our sakes. If the blessed Christ had lived
here all these nineteen hundred years, without sin, teaching
all his marvellous precepts with his own sublime
and simple eloquence, yet he had not produced one
single atom of spiritual life among all the sons of men.
Without dying he brings forth no fruit. If you want
life, my dear hearer, you will not get it as an unregenerate
man by attempting to imitate the example of Christ.
You may get good of a certain sort that way, but you
will never obtain spiritual life and eternal salvation by
that method. You must believe on Jesus as dying for
you. You have to understand that the blood of Jesus
Christ, God's dear Son, cleanses us from all sin. When
you have learned that truth, you shall study his life with
advantage; but unless you recognize that the grain of
wheat is cast into the ground, and made to die, you will
never realize any fruit from it in your own soul, or see
fruit in the souls of others.</p>

<p>One other blessed lesson of deep divinity is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
learnt from our text: it is this&mdash;<i>since Jesus Christ did
really fall into the ground and die, we may expect much as the
result of it</i>. "If it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."
Some have a little Christ, and they expect to see little
things come of him. I have met with good people who
appear to think that Jesus Christ died for the sound
people who worship at Zoar Chapel, and, perhaps, for a
few more who go to Ebenezer in a neighboring town,
and they hope that one day a chosen few&mdash;a scanty
company indeed they are, and they do their best by
mutual quarrelling to make them fewer&mdash;will glorify
God for the salvation of a very small remnant. I will
not blame these dear brethren, but I do wish that
their hearts were enlarged. We do not yet know all
the fruit that is to come out of our Lord Jesus. May
there not come a day when the millions of London shall
worship God with one consent? I look for a day when
the knowledge of the glory of God shall cover the earth
as the waters cover the sea, when kings shall fall down
before the Son of God, and all nations shall call him
blessed. "It is too much to expect," says one; "missions
make very slow progress." I know all that, but
missions are not the seed: all that we look for is to
come out of that corn of wheat which fell into the
ground and died: this is to bring forth much fruit. When
I think of my Master's blessed person as perfect Son of
God and Son of man; when I think of the infinite glory
which he laid aside, and of the unutterable pangs he
bore, I ask whether angels can compute the value of
the sacrifice he offered. God only knows the love of
God that was manifested in the death of his Son, and
do you think that there will be all this planning and
working and sacrifice of infinite love, and then an insig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>nificant
result? It is not like God that it should be so.
The travail of the Son of God shall not bring forth a
scanty good. The result shall be commensurate with
the means, and the effect shall be parallel with the
cause. The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. Hallelujah!
Ay, as the groanings of the cross must have
astounded angels, so shall the results of the cross
amaze the seraphim, and make them admire the excess
of glory which has arisen from the shameful death of
their Lord. O beloved, great things are to come out of
our Jesus yet. Courage, you that are dispirited. Be
brave, you soldiers of the cross. Victory awaits your
banner. Wait patiently, work hopefully, suffer joyfully,
for the kingdom is the Lord's, and he is the governor
among the nations.</p>

<p>Thus have I spoken upon profound divinity.</p>

<p>I close with a few words upon <span class="smcap">practical instruction</span>.
Learn now that what is true of Christ is in
measure true of every child of God: "Except a corn of
wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:
but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." This is so
far applicable to us, as the next verse indicates&mdash;"He
that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his
life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."</p>

<p>First, <i>we must die if we are to live</i>. There is no spiritual
life for you, for me, for any man, except by dying
into it. Have you a fine-spun righteousness of your
own? It must die. Have you any faith in yourself?
It must die. The sentence of death must be in yourself,
and then you shall enter into life. The withering
power of the Spirit of God must be experienced
before his quickening influence can be known: "The
grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the Lord bloweth upon it." You must be slain by
the sword of the Spirit before you can be made alive by
the breath of the Spirit.</p>

<p>Next, <i>we must surrender everything to keep it</i>. "He
that loveth his life shall lose it." Brother, you can never
have spiritual life, hope, joy, peace, heaven, except by
giving everything up into God's hands. You shall
have everything in Christ when you are willing to
have nothing of your own. You must ground your
weapons of rebellion, you must drop the plumes of your
pride, you must give up into God's hand all that you
are and all that you have; and if you do not thus lose
everything in will, you shall lose everything in fact;
indeed, you have lost it already. A full surrender of
everything to God is the only way to keep it. Some of
God's people find this literally true. I have known a
mother keep back her child from God, and the child has
died. Wealthy people have worshipped their wealth,
and as they were God's people, he has broken their
idols into shivers. You must lose your all if you would
keep it, and renounce your most precious thing if you
would have it preserved to you.</p>

<p>Next, <i>we must lose self in order to find self</i>. "He that
hateth his life shall keep it unto life eternal." You must
entirely give up living for yourself, and then you yourself
shall live. The man who lives for himself does not
live; he loses the essence, the pleasure, the crown of existence;
but if you live for others and for God you will
find the life of life. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God
and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added
unto you." There is no way of finding yourself in personal
joy like losing yourself in the joy of others.</p>

<p>Once more: if you <i>wish to be the means of life to others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
you must in your measure die yourself</i>. "Oh," say you,
"will it actually come to death?" Well, it may not,
but you should be prepared for it if it should. Who
have most largely blessed the present age? I will tell
you. I believe we owe our gospel liberties mainly to
the poor men and women who died at the stake for the
faith. Call them Lollards, Anabaptists, or what you
will, the men who died for it gave life to the holy
cause. Some of all ranks did this, from bishops downward
to poor boys. Many of them could not preach
from the pulpit, but they preached grander sermons
from the fagots than all the reformers could thunder
from their rostrums. They fell into the ground and
died, and the "much fruit" abides to this day. The
self-sacrificing death of her saints was the life and increase
of the church. If we wish to achieve a great purpose,
establish a great truth, and raise up a great agency
for good, it must be by the surrender of ourselves, yea,
of our very lives to the one all-absorbing purpose. Not
else can we succeed. There is no giving out to others,
without taking so much out of yourself. He who serves
God and finds that it is easy work will find it hard work
to give in his account at the last. A sermon that costs
nothing is worth nothing; if it did not come from the
heart it will not go to the heart. Take it as a rule that
wear and tear must go on, even to exhaustion, if we are
to be largely useful. Death precedes growth. The Saviour
of others cannot save himself. We must not, therefore,
grudge the lives of those who die under the evil
climate of Africa, if they die for Christ; nor must we
murmur if here and there God's best servants are cut
down by brain exhaustion: it is the law of divine
husbandry that by death cometh increase.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>And you, dear friend, must not say, "Oh, I cannot
longer teach in the Sunday-school: I work so hard all
the week that I&mdash;I&mdash;I"&mdash;shall I finish the sentence
for you? You work so hard for yourself all the week
that you cannot work for God one day in the week. Is
that it? "No, not quite so, but I am so fagged." Very
true, but think of your Lord. He knew what weariness
was for you, and yet he wearied not in well-doing. You
will never come to sweat of blood as he did. Come, dear
friend, will you be a corn of wheat laid up on the shelf
alone? Will you be like that wheat in the mummy's
hand, unfruitful and forgotten, or would you grow?
I hear you say, "Sow me somewhere." I will try to
do so. Let me drop you into the Sunday-school field,
or into the Tract-lending acre, or into the Street-preaching
parcel of land. "But if I make any great exertion
it will half kill me." Yes; and if it shall quite kill,
you will then prove the text, "If it die, it bringeth
forth much fruit." Those who have killed themselves
of late in our Lord's service are not so numerous that
we need be distressed by the fear that an enormous
sacrifice of life is likely to occur. Little cause is there
just now to repress fanaticism, but far more reason to
denounce self-seeking. O, my brethren, let us rise to
a condition of consecration more worthy of our Lord
and of his glorious cause, and henceforth may we be
eager to be as the buried, hidden, dying, yet fruit-bearing
wheat for the glory of our Lord. Thus have I merely
glanced at the text; another day may it be our privilege
to dive into its depths.</p>


<h2><a name="THE_PLOUGHMAN" id="THE_PLOUGHMAN">THE PLOUGHMAN.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"Doth the ploughman plough all day to sow?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> 28:24.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Unless</span> they are cultivated, fields yield us nothing
but briers and thistles. In this we may see ourselves.
Unless the great Husbandman shall till us by his grace,
we shall produce nothing that is good, but everything
that is evil. If one of these days I shall hear that a
country has been discovered where wheat grows without
the work of the farmer, I may then, perhaps, hope
to find one of our race who will bring forth holiness
without the grace of God. Hitherto all land on which
the foot of man has trodden has needed labor and care;
and even so among men the need of gracious tillage is
universal. Jesus says to all of us, "Ye must be born
again." Unless God the Holy Spirit breaks up the
heart with the plough of the law, and sows it with the
seed of the gospel, not a single ear of holiness will any
of us produce, even though we may be children of godly
parents, and may be regarded as excellent moral people
by those with whom we live.</p>

<p>Yes, and the plough is needed not only to produce
that which is good, but to destroy that which is evil.
There are diseases which, in the course of ages, wear
themselves out, and do not appear again among men;
and there may be forms of vice, which under changed
circumstances, do not so much abound as they used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
do; but human nature will always remain the same,
and therefore there will always be plentiful crops of the
weeds of sin in man's fields, and nothing can keep these
under but spiritual husbandry, carried on by the Spirit
of God. You cannot destroy weeds by exhortations,
nor can you tear out the roots of sin from the soul by
moral suasion; something sharper and more effectual
must be brought to bear upon them. God must put his
own right hand to the plough, or the hemlock of sin will
never give place to the corn of holiness. Good is never
spontaneous in unrenewed humanity, and evil is never
cut up till the ploughshare of almighty grace is driven
through it.</p>

<p>The text leads our thoughts in this direction, and
gives us practical guidance through asking the simple
question, "Doth the ploughman plough all day to sow?"
<i>This question may be answered in the affirmative</i>, "Yes, in
the proper season he does plough all day to sow;" and,
secondly, <i>this text may more properly be answered in the negative</i>,
"No, the ploughman does not plough every day to
sow; he has other work to do according to the season."</p>

<p>I. First, our text may be <span class="smcap">answered in the affirmative</span>&mdash;"Yes,
the ploughman does plough all day to
sow."</p>

<p>When it is ploughing time he keeps on at it till his
work is done; if it requires one day, or two days, or
twenty days to finish his fields, he continues at his task
while the weather permits. The perseverance of the
ploughman is instructive, and it teaches us a double lesson.
When the Lord comes to plough the heart of
man he ploughs all day, and herein is his patience; and,
secondly, so ought the Lord's servants to labor all day
with men's hearts, and herein is our perseverance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doth the ploughman plough all day?" <i>So doth
God plough the heart of man, and herein is his patience.</i> The
team was in the field in the case of some of us very early
in the morning, for our first recollections have to do
with conscience and the furrows of pain which it made
in our youthful mind. When we were little children
we woke in the night under a sense of sin; our father's
teaching and our mother's prayers made deep and painful
impressions upon us, and though we did not then
yield our hearts to God, we were greatly stirred, and all
indifference to religion was made impossible. When we
were boys at school the reading of a chapter in the Word
of God, or the death of a playmate, or an address at a
Bible-class, or a solemn sermon, so affected us that we
were uneasy for weeks. The strivings of the Spirit of
God within urged us to think of higher and better things.
Though we quenched the Spirit, though we stifled conviction,
yet we bore the marks of the ploughshare; furrows
were made in the soul, and certain foul weeds of
evil were cut up by the roots although no seed of grace
was as yet sown in our hearts. Some have continued
in this state for many years, ploughed but not sown;
but, blessed be God, it was not so with others of us;
for we had not left boyhood before the good seed of the
gospel fell upon our heart. Alas! there are many who
do not thus yield to grace, and with them the ploughman
ploughs all day to sow. I have seen the young man coming
to London in his youth, yielding to its temptations,
drinking in its poisoned sweets, violating his conscience,
and yet continuing unhappy in it all, fearful, unrestful,
stirred about even as the soil is agitated by the
plough. In how many cases has this kind of work gone
on for years, and all to no avail. Ah! and I have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the man come to middle life, and still he has not received
the good seed, neither has the ground of his hard
heart been thoroughly broken up. He has gone on in
business without God; day after day he has risen and
gone to bed again with no more religion than his horses:
and yet all this while there have been ringing in his ears
warnings of judgment to come, and chidings of conscience,
so that he has not been at peace. After a powerful
sermon he has not enjoyed his meals, or been able to
sleep, for he has asked himself, "What shall I do in the
end thereof?" The ploughman has ploughed all day,
till the evening shadows have lengthened and the day
has faded to a close. What a mercy it is when the
furrows are at last made ready and the good seed is cast
in, to be received, nurtured, and multiplied a hundred
fold.</p>

<p>It is mournful to remember that we have seen
this ploughing continue till the sun has touched the horizon
and the night dews have begun to fall. Even then
the long-suffering God has followed up his work&mdash;ploughing,
ploughing, ploughing, ploughing, till darkness
ended all. Do I address any aged ones whose lease
must soon run out? I would affectionately beseech them
to consider their position. What! Threescore years old
and yet unsaved? Forty years did God suffer the manners
of Israel in the wilderness, but he has borne with
you for sixty years. Seventy years old, and yet unregenerated!
Ah, my friend, you will have but little time
in which to serve your Saviour before you go to heaven.
But will you go there at all? Is it not growing dreadfully
likely that you will die in your sins and perish
for ever? How happy are those who are brought to
Christ in early life; but still remember&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>It is late, it is very late, but is not too late. The ploughman
ploughs all day; and the Lord waits that he may
be gracious unto you. I have seen many aged persons
converted, and therefore I would encourage other old
folks to believe in Jesus. I once read a sermon in which
a minister asserted that he had seldom known any converted
who were over forty years of age if they had been
hearers of the gospel all their lives. There is certainly
much need to caution those who are guilty of delay, but
there must be no manufacturing of facts. Whatever
that minister might think, or even observe, my own
observation leads me to believe that about as many
people are converted to God at one age as at another,
taking into consideration the fact that the young are
much more numerous than the old. It is a dreadful
thing to have remained an unbeliever all these years; but
yet the grace of God does not stop short at a certain
age; those who enter the vineyard at the eleventh hour
shall have their penny, and grace shall be glorified in
the old as well as in the young. Come along, old friend,
Jesus Christ invites you to come to him even now, though
you have stood out so long. You have been a sadly
tough piece of ground, and the ploughman has ploughed
all day; but if at last the sods are turned, and the heart
is lying in ridges, there is hope of you yet.</p>

<p>"Doth the ploughman plough all day?" I answer&mdash;Yes,
however long the day may be, God in mercy
ploughs still, he is long-suffering, and full of tenderness
and mercy and grace. Do not spurn such patience, but
yield to the Lord who has acted toward you with so
much gentle love.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The text, however, not only sets forth patience on
God's part, but it teaches <i>perseverance on our part</i>. "Doth
the ploughman plough all day?" Yes, he does; then if
I am seeking Christ, ought I to be discouraged because
I do not immediately find him? The promise is, "He
that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth;
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened." There
may be reasons why the door is not opened at our first
knock. What then? "Doth the ploughman plough
all day?" Then will I knock all day. It may be at the
first seeking I may not find; what then? "Doth the
ploughman plough all day?" Then will I seek all day.
It may happen that at my first asking I shall not receive;
what then? "Doth the ploughman plough all day?"
Then will I ask all day? Friends, if you have begun
to seek the Lord, the short way is, "Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." Do that at once.
In the name of God do it at once, and you are saved at
once. May the Spirit of God bring you to faith in Jesus,
and you are at once in the kingdom of Christ. But if
peradventure in seeking the Lord, you are ignorant of
this, or do not see your way, never give up seeking;
get to the foot of the cross, lay hold of it, and cry, "If I
perish I will perish here. Lord, I come to thee in Jesus
Christ for mercy, and if thou art not pleased to look
at me immediately, and forgive my sins, I will cry to
thee till thou dost." When God's Holy Spirit brings a
man to downright earnest prayer which will not take a
denial, he is not far from peace. Careless indifference
and shilly-shallying with God hold men in bondage.
They find peace when their hearts are roused to strong
resolve to seek until they find. I like to see men search
the Scriptures till they learn the way of salvation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
hear the gospel till their souls live by it. If they are
resolved to drive the plough through doubts, and fears,
and difficulties, till they come to salvation, they shall
soon come to it by the grace of God.</p>

<p>The same is true in seeking the salvation of others.
"Doth the ploughman plough all day?" Yes, when it
is ploughing-time. Then, so will I work on, and on,
and on. I will pray and preach, or pray and teach,
however long the day may be that God shall appoint
me, for&mdash;</p>

<div class="line small">"'Tis all my business here below</div>
<div class="line small ip5">The precious gospel seed to sow."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Brother worker, are you getting a little weary?
Never mind, rouse yourself, and plough on for the love
of Jesus, and dying men. Our day of work has in it
only the appointed hours, and while they last let us fulfil
our task. Ploughing is hard work; but as there will be
no harvest without it, let us just put forth all our strength,
and never flag till we have performed our Lord's will,
and by his holy Spirit wrought conviction in men's souls.
Some soils are very stiff, and cling together, and the
labor is heart-breaking; others are like the unreclaimed
waste, full of roots and tangled bramble; they need a
steam plough, and we must pray the Lord to make us
such, for we cannot leave them untilled, and therefore we
must put forth more strength that the labor may be done.</p>

<p>I heard some time ago of a minister who called to
see a poor man who was dying, but he was not able to
gain admittance; he called the next morning, and
some idle excuse was made so that he could not see
him; he called again the next morning, but he was
still refused; he went on till he called twenty times in
vain, but on the twenty-first occasion he was permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to see the sufferer, and by God's grace he saved a soul
from death. "Why do you tell your child a thing twenty
times?" asked some one of a mother. "Because,"
said she, "I find nineteen times is not enough." Now,
when a soul is to be ploughed, it may so happen that
hundreds of furrows will not do it. What then? Why,
plough all day till the work is done. Whether you
are ministers, missionaries, teachers, or private soul-winners,
never grow weary, for your work is noble,
and the reward of it is infinite. The grace of God is
seen in our being permitted to engage in such holy
service; it is greatly magnified in sustaining us in it,
and it will be pre-eminently conspicuous in enabling
us to hold out till we can say, "I have finished the work
which thou gavest me to do."</p>

<p>We prize that which costs us labor and service, and
we shall set all the higher value upon the saved ones
when the Lord grants them to our efforts. It is good
for us to learn the value of our sheaves by going forth
weeping to the sowing. When you think of the ploughman's
ploughing all day, be moved to plod on in earnest
efforts to win souls. Seek&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"With cries, entreaties, tears to save</div>
<div class="line small ip5">And snatch them from the fiery wave."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Doth the ploughman plough all day for a little bit of
oats or barley, and will not you plough all day for souls
that shall live for ever, if saved, to adore the grace of
God, or shall live for ever, if unsaved, in outer darkness
and woe? Oh, by the terrors of the wrath to come and
the glory that is to be revealed, gird up your loins,
and plough all day.</p>

<p>I would beg all the members of our churches to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
keep their hands on the gospel plough, and their eyes
straight before them. "Doth the ploughman plough
all day?" let Christians do the same. Start close to
the hedge, and go right down to the bottom of the
field. Plough as close to the ditch as you can, and
leave small headlands. What though there are fallen
women, thieves, and drunkards in the slums around,
do not neglect any of them; for if you leave a stretch
of land to the weeds they will soon spread among
the wheat. When you have gone right to the end of
the field once, what shall you do next? Why, just
turn round, and make for the place you started
from. And when you have thus been up and down,
what next? Why, up and down again. And what
next? Why, up and down again. You have visited
that district with tracts; do it again, fifty-two
times in the year&mdash;multiply your furrows. We must
learn how to continue in well doing. Your eternal
destiny is to go on doing good for ever and ever, and it
is well to go through a rehearsal here. So just plough
on, plough on, and look for results as the reward of
continued perseverance. Ploughing is not done with
a skip and jump; the ploughman ploughs all day.
Dash and flash are all very fine in some things, but not
in ploughing; there the work must be steady, persistent,
regular. Certain persons soon give it up, it wears out
their gloves, blisters their soft hands, tires their bones,
and makes them eat their bread rather more in the
sweat of their face than they care for. Those whom
the Lord fills with his grace will keep to their ploughing
year after year, and verily I say unto you, they shall
have their reward. "Doth the ploughman plough all
day?" Then let us do the same, being assured that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
one day every hill and valley shall be tilled and sown,
and every desert and wilderness shall yield a harvest
for our Lord, and the angel reapers shall descend, and
the shouts of the harvest-home shall fill both earth and
heaven.</p>

<p>II. But, now, somewhat briefly, <span class="smcap">the text may be
answered in the negative</span>. "Doth the ploughman
plough all day to sow?" No, he does not always
plough. After he has ploughed he breaks the clods,
sows, reaps, and threshes. In the chapter before us you
will see that other works of husbandry are mentioned.
The ploughman has many other things to do beside
ploughing. There is an advance in what he does; this
teaches us that there is the like on God's part, and
should be the like on ours.</p>

<p>First, <i>on God's part, there is an advance in what he does</i>.
"Doth the ploughman plough all day?" No, he goes forward
to other matters. It may be that in the case of some
of you the Lord has been using certain painful agencies
to plough you. You are feeling the terrors of the law,
the bitterness of sin, the holiness of God, the weakness
of the flesh, and the shadow of the wrath to come. Is
this going to last forever? Will it continue till the
spirit fails and the soul expires? Listen: "Doth the
ploughman plough all day?" No, he is preparing for
something else&mdash;he ploughs to sow. Thus doth the
Lord deal with you; therefore be of good courage, there
is an ending to the wounding and slaying, and better
things are in store for you. You are poor and needy,
and you seek water, and there is none and your tongue
faileth for thirst; but the Lord will hear you, and deliver
you. He will not contend forever, neither will he
be always wroth. He will turn again, and he will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
compassion upon us. He will not always make furrows
by his chiding, he will come and cast in the precious
corn of consolation, and water it with the dews of heaven
and smile upon it with the sunlight of his grace; and
there shall soon be in you, first the blade, then the ear,
after that the full corn in the ear, and in due season you
shall joy as with the joy of harvest. O ye who are sore
wounded in the place of dragons, I hear you cry,
Doth God always send terror and conviction of sin?
Listen to this: "If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall
eat the good of the land," and what is the call of God to
the willing and obedient but this: "Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." Thou shalt be
saved now, find peace now, if thou wilt have done with
thyself and all looking to thine own good works to save
thee, and wilt turn to him who paid the ransom for
thee upon the tree. The Lord is gentle and tender and
full of compassion, he will not always chide, neither
will he keep his anger for ever. Many of your doubts
and fears come of unbelief, or of Satan, or of the flesh,
and are not of God at all. Blame him not for what he
does not send, and does not wish you to suffer. His
mind is for your peace, not for your distress; for thus
he speaks: "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith
your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and
cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her
iniquity is pardoned." "I have blotted out, as a thick
cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins:
return unto me; for I have redeemed thee." He has
smitten, but he will smile; he has wounded, but he will
heal; he has slain, but he will make alive; therefore
turn unto him at once and receive comfort at his hands.
The ploughman does not plough for ever, else would he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
reap no harvest; and God is not always heart-breaking,
he also draws near on heart-healing errands.</p>

<p>You see, then, that the great husbandman advances
from painful agencies, and I want you to mark that he
goes on to <i>productive work</i> in the hearts of his people.
He will take away the furrows, you shall not see them,
for the corn will cover them with beauty. As she that
was in travail remembers no more her sorrow for joy that
a man is born into the world, so shall you, who are
under the legal rod, remember no more the misery of
conviction, for God will sow you with grace, and make
your soul, even your poor, barren soul, to bring forth
fruit unto his praise and glory. "Oh!" says one, "I
wish that would come true to me." It will. "Doth
the ploughman plough all day to sow?" You expect
by-and-by to see ploughed fields clothed with springing
corn; and you may look to see repentant hearts gladdened
with forgiveness. Therefore, be of good courage.</p>

<p>You shall advance, also, to a <i>joyful experience</i>. See
that ploughman; he whistles as he ploughs, he does not
own much of this world's goods, but yet he is merry.
He looks forward to the day when he will be on the
top of the big wagon, joining in the shout of the harvest
home, and so he ploughs in hope, expecting a crop.
And, dear soul, God will yet joy and rejoice over you
when you believe in Jesus Christ, and you, too, shall
be brimful of joy. Be of good cheer, the better portion
is yet to come, press forward to it. Gospel sorrowing
leads on to gospel hoping, believing, rejoicing, and the
rejoicing knows no end. God will not chasten all day,
but he will lead you on from strength to strength, from
glory unto glory, till you shall be like himself. This,
then, is the advance that there is in God's work among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
men, from painful agencies to productive work and
joyful experience.</p>

<p>But what if the ploughing should never lead to sowing;
what if you should be disturbed in conscience,
and should go on to resist it all? Then God will make
another advance, but it will be to put up the plough,
and to command the clouds that they rain no rain upon
the land, and then its end is to be burned. Oh! man,
there is nothing more awful than for your soul to be left
to go out of cultivation; God himself giving you up.
Surely that is hell. He that is unholy will be unholy
still. The law of fixity of character will operate eternally,
and no hand of the merciful One shall come
near to till the soul again. What worse than this can
happen?</p>

<p>We conclude by saying that <i>this advance is a lesson to
us</i>; for we, too, are to go forward. "Doth the ploughman
plough all day?" No, he ploughs to sow, and in due time
he sows. Some churches seem to think that all they
have to do is to plough; at least, all they attempt is a kind
of scratching of the soil, and talking of what they are
going to do. It is fine talk, certainly; but doth the
ploughman plough all day? You may draw up a large
programme and promise great things; but pray do not
stop there. Don't be making furrows all day; do get
to your sowing. I fancy that those who promise most
perform the least. Men who do much in the world have
no programme at first, their course works itself out by
its own inner force by the grace of God; they do not
propose but perform. They do not plough all day to
sow, but they are like our Lord's servant in the parable
of whom he saith, "the sower went forth to sow."</p>

<p>Let the ministers of Christ also follow the rule of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
advance. <i>Let us go from preaching the law to preaching
the gospel.</i> "Doth the ploughman plough all day?" He
does plough; he would not sow in hope if he had not
first prepared the ground. Robbie Flockart, who
preached for years in the Edinboro' streets, says, "It is
in vain to sew with the silk thread of the gospel, unless
you use the sharp needle of the law." Some of my
brethren do not care to preach eternal wrath and its terrors.
This is a cruel mercy, for they ruin souls by hiding
from them their ruin. If they must needs try to
sew without a needle, I cannot help it; but I do not
mean to be so foolish myself; my needle may be old-fashioned,
but it is sharp, and when it carries with it the
silken thread of the gospel, I am sure good work is done
by it. You cannot get a harvest if you are afraid of disturbing
the soil, nor can you save souls if you never
warn them of hell fire. We must tell the sinner what
God has revealed about sin, righteousness, and judgment
to come. Still, brethren, we must not plough all day.
No, no, the preaching of the law is only preparatory
to the preaching of the gospel. The stress of our business
lies in proclaiming glad tidings. We are not followers
of John the Baptist, but of Jesus Christ; we are
not rugged prophets of woe, but joyful heralds of grace.
Be not satisfied with revival services, and stirring appeals,
but preach the doctrines of grace so as to bring
out the full compass of covenant truth. Ploughing
has had its turn, now for planting and watering. Reproof
may now give place to consolation. We are first to
make disciples of men, and then to teach them to observe
all things whatsoever Jesus has commanded us.
We must pass on from the rudiments to the higher
truths, from laying foundations to further upbuilding.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, another lesson to those of you who are as
yet hearers and nothing more. I want you to go from
ploughing to something better, namely, <i>from hearing and
fearing to believing</i>. How many years some of you have
been hearing the gospel! Do you mean to continue in
that state for ever? Will you never believe in him of
whom you hear so much? You have been stirred up a
good deal; the other night you went home almost
broken-hearted; I should think you are ploughed
enough by this time; and yet you have not received the
seed of eternal life, for you have not believed in the Lord
Jesus. It is dreadful to be always on the brink of everlasting
life, and yet never to be alive. It will be an
awful thing to be almost in heaven, and yet forever
shut out. It is a wretched thing to rush into a railway
station just in time to see the train steaming out; I
had much rather be half-an-hour behind time. To lose
a train by half-a-second is most annoying. Alas, if you
go on as you have done for years, you will have your hand
on the latch of heaven, and yet be shut out. You will
be within a hair's-breadth of glory, and yet be covered
with eternal shame. O beware of being so near to the
kingdom, and yet lost; almost, but not altogether saved.
God grant that you may not be among those who are
ploughed, and ploughed, and ploughed, and yet never
sown. It will be of no avail at the last to cry, "Lord,
we have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast
taught in our streets. We had a seat at the chapel, we
attended the services on week-nights as well as on Sundays,
we went to prayer-meetings, we joined a Bible-class,
we distributed tracts, we subscribed our guinea to
the funds, we gave up every open sin, we used a form
of prayer, and read a chapter of the Bible every day."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
All these things may be done, and yet there may be no
saving faith in the Lord Jesus. Take heed lest your
Lord should answer, "With all this, your heart never
came to me; therefore, depart from me, I never knew
you." If Jesus once knows a man he always knows
him. He can never say to <i>me</i>, "I never knew you," for
he has known me, as his poor dependant, a beggar for
years at his door. Some of you have been all that is
good except that you never came into contact with
Christ, never trusted him, never knew him. Ah me,
how sad your state! Will it be always so?</p>

<p>Lastly, I would say to you who are being ploughed
and are agitated about your souls, Go at once to the next
stage of believing. Oh! if people did but know how
simple a thing believing is, surely they would believe.
Alas, they do not know it, and it becomes all the
more difficult to them because in itself it is so easy.
The difficulty of believing lies in there being no difficulty
in it. "If the prophet had bid thee do some great
thing, wouldst thou not have done it?" Oh, yes, you
would have done it, and you would have thought it easy
too; but when he simply says, "Wash, and be clean,"
there is a difficulty with pride and self. If you can truly
say that you are willing to abase your pride, and do
anything which the Lord bids you, then I pray you
understand that there is no further preparation required,
and believe in Jesus at once. May the Holy Spirit make
you sick of self, and ready to accept the gospel. The
word is nigh thee, let it be believed; it is in thy mouth,
let it be swallowed down; it is in thy heart, let it be
trusted. With your heart believe in Jesus, and with
your mouth make confession of him, and you shall be
saved. A main part of faith lies in the giving up of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
other confidences. O give up at once every false hope.
I tried once to show what faith was by quoting Dr.
Watts's lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,</div>
<div class="line small i2">On thy kind arms I fall.</div>
<div class="line small ip5">Be thou my strength, and righteousness,</div>
<div class="line small i2">My Jesus and my all."</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>I tried to represent faith as falling into Christ's arms,
and I thought I made it so plain that the wayfaring
man could not err therein. When I had finished preaching,
a young man came to me and said, "But, sir, I
cannot fall upon Christ's arms." I replied at once,
"Tumble into them anyhow; faint away into Christ's
arms, or die into Christ's arms, so long as you get
there." Many talk of what they can do and what they
cannot do, and I fear they miss the vital point. Faith
is leaving off can-ing and cannot-ing, and leaving it all
to Christ, for <i>he</i> can do all things, though you can do
nothing. "Doth the ploughman plough all day to
sow?" No, he makes progress, and goes from ploughing
to sowing. Go, and do thou likewise; sow unto
the Spirit the precious seed of faith in Christ, and the
Lord will give thee a joyous harvest.</p>


<h2><a name="PLOUGHING_THE_ROCK" id="PLOUGHING_THE_ROCK">PLOUGHING THE ROCK.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plough there with oxen?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Amos</span> 6:12.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">These</span> expressions are proverbs, taken from the
familiar sayings of the east country. A proverb is generally
a sword with two edges, or, if I may so say, it
has many edges, or is all edge, and hence it may be
turned this way and that way, and every part of it will
have force and point. A proverb has often many bearings,
and you cannot always tell what was the precise
meaning of him who uttered it. The connection would
abundantly tolerate two senses in this place. An
ancient commentator asserts that it has seven meanings,
and that any one of them would be consistent with the
context. I cannot deny the assertion, and if it be correct
it is only one among many instances of the manifold
wisdom of the Word of God. Like those curiously
carved Chinese balls in which there is one ball within
another, so in many a holy text there is sense within
sense, teaching within teaching, and each one worthy
of the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>The first sense of the text upon which I would say
just a word or two is this: The prophet is expostulating
with ungodly men upon their <i>pursuit of happiness where
it never can be found</i>. They were endeavoring to grow
rich and great and strong by oppression. The prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
says, "Ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit
of righteousness into hemlock." Justice was bought and
sold among them, and the book of the law was made the
instrument of fraud. "Yet," says the prophet, "there
is no gain to be gotten in this way&mdash;no real profit, no
true happiness. As well may horses run upon a rock,
and oxen plough the sand; it is labor in vain."</p>

<p>If any of you try to content yourselves with this
world, any hope to find a heaven in the midst of your
business and your family without looking upward for
it, you labor in vain. If you hope to find pleasure in
sin, and think that it will go well with you if you despise
the law of God, you will make a great mistake. You
might as well seek for roses in the grottoes of the sea,
or look for pearls on the pavements of the city. You
will find what your soul requires nowhere but in God.
To seek after happiness in evil deeds is to plough a rock
of granite. To labor after true prosperity by dishonest
means is as useless as to till the sandy shore. "Wherefore
do you spend your money for that which is not
bread, and your labor for that which satisfieth not?"
Young man, you are killing yourself with ambition;
you seek your own honor and emolument, and this is a
poor, poor object for an immortal soul. And you, too,
sir, are wearing out your life with care; your mind and
body both fail you in endeavoring to amass riches, as if
a man's life consisted in the abundance of the things
which he possesses; you are ploughing a rock; your
cares will not bring you joy of heart or content of spirit;
your toil will end in failure. And you, too, who labor
to weave a righteousness by your works apart from
Christ and fancy that with the diligent use of outward
ceremonies you may be able to do the work of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Spirit upon your own heart, you, too, are ploughing
thankless rock. The strength of fallen nature exerted
at its utmost can never save a soul. Why, then, plough
the rock any longer? Give over the foolish task.</p>

<p>So far, I believe, we have not misread the text, but
have mentioned a very probable meaning of the words;
still another strikes me, which I think equally suitable,
and upon it I shall dwell, by God's help.</p>

<p>It is this. <i>God will not always send his ministers to call
men to repentance.</i> When men's hearts remain obdurate,
and they do not and will not repent, then God
will not always deal with them in mercy. "My Spirit
shall not always strive with man." There is a time of
ploughing, but when it is evident that the heart is
wilfully hardened, then wisdom itself suggests to mercy
that she should give over her efforts. "Shall horses run
upon the rock? will one plough there with oxen?" No,
there is a limit to the efforts of kindness, and in fulness
of time the labor ceases, and the rock remains unploughed
henceforth and for ever.</p>


<p class="p2">I. Taking that sense, we shall speak upon it, and
remark, first, that <span class="smcap">ministers labor to break up men's
hearts</span>; the wise preacher tries by the power of the
Holy Ghost to break up the hard clods of the heart, so
that it may receive the heavenly seed.</p>

<p>Many truths are used like sharp ploughshares to
break up the heart. Men must be made to feel that they
have sinned, and they must be led to repent of sin.
They must receive Christ, not with the head only, but
with the heart; for with the heart man believeth unto
righteousness. There must be emotion; we must cut
into the heart with the ploughshare of the law. A farmer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
who is too tender-hearted to tear and harrow the land
will never see a harvest. Here is the failing of certain
divines, they are afraid of hurting any one's feelings,
and so they keep clear of all the truths which are likely
to excite fear or grief. They have not a sharp ploughshare
on their premises, and are never likely to have a
stack in their rickyard. They angle without hooks for
fear of hurting the fish, and fire without bullets out of
respect to the feelings of the birds. This kind of love
is real cruelty to men's souls. It is much the same as
if a surgeon should permit a patient to die because he
would not pain him with the lancet, or by the necessary
removal of a limb. It is a terrible tenderness which
leaves men to sink into hell rather than distress their
minds. It is pleasant to prophesy smooth things, but
woe unto the man who thus degrades himself. Is this
the spirit of Christ? Did he conceal the sinner's peril?
Did he cast doubt upon the unquenchable fire and the undying
worm? Did he lull souls into slumber by smooth
strains of flattery? Nay, but with honest love and
anxious concern he warned men of the wrath to come,
and bade them repent or perish. Let the servant of the
Lord Jesus in this thing follow his Master, and plough
deep with a sharp ploughshare, which will not be balked
by the hardest clods. This we must school ourselves to
do. If we really love the souls of men, let us prove it
by honest speech. The hard heart must be broken,
or it will still refuse the Saviour who was sent to bind
up the broken-hearted. There are some things which
men may or may not have, and yet may be saved; but
those things which go with the ploughing of the heart
are indispensable; there must be a holy fear and a humble
trembling before God; there must be an acknowledg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>ment
of guilt and a penitent petition for mercy; there
must, in a word, be a thorough ploughing of the soul
before we can expect the seed to bring forth fruit.</p>


<p class="p2">II. But the text indicates to us that <span class="smcap">at times ministers
labor in vain</span>. "Shall horses run upon the rock?
will one plough there with oxen?" In a short time a
ploughman feels whether the plough will go or not,
and so does the minister. He may use the very same
words in one place which he has used in another, but
he feels in the one place great joy and hopefulness in
preaching, while with another audience he has heavy
work, and little hope. The plough in the last case seems
to jump out of the furrow; and a bit of the share is
broken off now and then. He says to himself, "I do not
know how it is, but I do not get on at this," and he finds
that his Master has sent him to work upon a particularly
heavy soil. All laborers for Christ know that
this is occasionally the case. You must have found it so
in a Sunday-school class, or in a cottage meeting, or in
any other gathering where you have tried to teach and
preach Jesus. You have said to yourself every now and
then, "Now I am ploughing a rock. Before, I turned up
rich mould which a yoke of oxen might plough with ease,
and a horse might even run at the work; but now the
horse may tug, and the oxen may wearily toil till they
gall their shoulders, but they cannot cut a furrow; the
rock is stubborn to the last degree."</p>

<p>There are such hearers in all congregations. They
are as iron, and yet they are side by side with a fine plot
of ground. Their sister, their brother, their son, their
daughter, all these have readily felt the power of the
gospel; but <i>they</i> do not feel it. They hear it respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>fully;
and they so far allow it free course that they permit
it to go in at one ear and out at the other, but they
will have nothing more to do with it. They would not
like to be Sabbath-breakers and stop away from worship;
they therefore do the gospel the questionable
compliment of coming where it is preached and then
refusing to regard it. They are hard, hard, hard bits
of rock, the plough does not touch them.</p>

<p>Many, on the other hand, are equally hard; but it
is in another way. The impression made by the word
is not deep or permanent. They receive it with joy, but
they do not retain it. They listen with attention, but it
never comes to practice with them. They hear about
repentance, but they never repent. They hear about
faith, but they never believe. They are good judges of
what the gospel is, and yet they have never accepted it
for themselves. They will not eat; but still they insist
that good bread shall be put on the table. They are
great sticklers for the very things which they personally
reject. They are moved to feeling; they shed tears
occasionally; but still their hearts are not really broken
up by the word. They go their way, and forget what
manner of men they are. They are rocky-hearted
through and through; all our attempts to plough them
are failures.</p>

<p>Now this is all the worse, because certain of these
rocky-hearted people have been ploughed for years, and
have become harder instead of softer. Once or twice
ploughing, and a broken share or two, and a disappointed
ploughman or two, we might not mind, if they would
yield at last; but these have since their childhood known
the gospel and never given way before its power. It is a
good while since their childhood now with some of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Their hair is turning gray, and they themselves are getting
feeble with years. They have been entreated
and persuaded times beyond number, but labor has been
lost upon them. In fact, they used to feel the word, in
a certain fashion, far more years ago than they do now.
The sun, which softens wax, hardens clay, and the same
gospel which has brought others to tenderness and repentance
has exercised a contrary effect upon them, and
made them more careless about divine things than they
were in their youth. This is a mournful state of things,
is it not?</p>

<p>Why are certain men so extremely rocky? Some
are so from a <i>peculiar stolidity of nature</i>. There are many
people in the world whom you cannot very well move,
they have a great deal of granite in their constitution, and
are more nearly related to Mr. Obstinate than to Mr.
Pliable. Now, I do not think badly of these people,
because one knows what it is to preach to an excitable
people, and to get them all stirred, and to know that
in the end they are none the better; whereas some of the
more stolid and immovable people when they are moved
are moved indeed; when they do feel they feel intensely,
and they retain any impression that is made. A little
chip made in granite by very hard blows will abide there,
while the lashing of water, which is easy enough, will
leave no trace even for a moment. It is a grand thing
to get hold of a fine piece of rock and to exercise faith
about it. The Lord's own hammer has mighty power to
break, and in the breaking great glory comes to the Most
High.</p>

<p>Worse still, certain men are hard because of their
<i>infidelity</i>&mdash;not heart-infidelity all of it, but an infidelity
which springs out of a desire not to believe, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
has helped them to discover difficulties. These difficulties
exist, and were meant to exist, for there would be no
room for faith if everything were as plain as the nose
on one's face. These persons have gradually come to
doubt, or to think that they doubt, essential truths, and
this renders them impervious to the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>A much more numerous body are orthodox enough,
but hard-hearted for all that. <i>Worldliness</i> hardens a
man in every way. It often dries up all charity to the
poor, because the man must make money, and he thinks
that the poor-rates are sufficient excuse for neglecting
the offices of charity. He has no time to think of the
next world; he must spend all his thoughts upon the
present one. Money is tight, and therefore he must hold
it tight; and when money brings in little interest, he
finds therein a reason for being the more niggardly. He
has no time for prayer, he <i>must</i> get down to the counting-house.
He has no time for reading his Bible, his ledger
wants him. You may knock at his door, but his heart
is not at home; it is in the counting-house, wherein he
lives and moves and has his being. His god is his gold,
his bliss is his business, his all in all is himself. What
is the use of preaching to him? As well may horses run
upon a rock, or oxen drag a plough across a field sheeted
with iron a mile thick.</p>

<p>With some, too, there is a hardness, produced by what
I might almost call the opposite of stern worldliness,
namely, a <i>general levity</i>. They are naturally butterflies
flitting about and doing nothing. They never think, or
want to think. Half a thought exhausts them, and they
must needs be diverted, or their feeble minds will utterly
weary. They live in a round of amusement. To them
the world is a stage, and all the men and women only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
players. It is of little use to preach to them; there is
no depth of earth in their superficial nature; beneath a
sprinkling of shifting worthless sand lies an impenetrable
rock of utter stupidity and senselessness. I might
thus multiply reasons why some are harder than others,
but it is a well-assured fact that they are so, and there I
leave the matter.</p>


<p class="p2">III. I shall now ask everybody to judge whether the
running of horses upon a rock and the ploughing there
with oxen shall always be continued. I assert that <span class="smcap">it is
unreasonable to expect that God's servants should
always continue to labor in vain</span>. These people have
been preached to, taught, instructed, admonished, expostulated
with, and advised; shall this unrecompensed
work be always performed? We have given them a fair
trial; what do reason and prudence say? Are we bound
to persevere till we are worn out by this unsuccessful
work? We will ask it of men who plough their own
farms; do they recommend perseverance when failure
is certain? Shall horses run upon the rock? Shall one
plough there with oxen? Surely not for ever.</p>

<p>I think we shall all agree that labor in vain cannot
be continued for ever if we consider <i>the ploughman</i>. He
does not want to be much considered; but still his
Master does not overlook him. See how weary he
grows when the work discourages him. He goes to his
Master with, "Who hath believed our report, and to
whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" "Why hast
thou sent me," says he, "to a people that have ears but
hear not? They sit as thy people sit, and they hear as
thy people hear, and then they go their way and they
forget every word that is spoken, and they obey not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the voice of the Lord." See how disappointed the
preacher becomes. It is always hard work when you
appear to get no forwarder, although you do your
utmost. No man, whoever he may be, likes to be set
upon work which appears to be altogether a waste of
time and effort. To his own mind it seems to have a
touch of the ridiculous about it, and he fears that he
will be despised of his fellows for aiming at the impossible.
Shall it always be the lot of God's ministers to
be trifled with? Will the great Husbandman bid his
ploughmen spill their lives for nought? Must his
preachers continue to cast pearls before swine? If the
consecrated workers are so bidden by their Lord they
will persevere in their painful task; but their Master is
considerate of them, and I ask <i>you</i> also to consider
whether it is reasonable to expect a zealous heart to be
for ever occupied with the salvation of those who never
respond to its anxiety? Shall the horses always plough
upon the rock? Shall the oxen always labor there?</p>

<p>Again, there is <i>the Master</i> to be considered. The
Lord&mdash;is he always to be resisted and provoked? Many
of you have had eternal life set before you as the result of
believing in Jesus; and you have refused to believe.
It is a wonder that my Lord has not said to me, "You
have done your duty with them; never set Christ before
them again; my Son shall not be insulted." If you offer
a beggar in the street a shilling and he will not have it,
you cheerfully put it into your purse and go your way;
you do not entreat him to have his wants relieved. But,
behold, our God in mercy begs sinners to come to him,
and implores them to accept his Son. In his condescension
he even stands like a salesman in the market, crying,
"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
waters, and he that hath no money; come, buy wine
and milk without money and without price." In another
place he says of himself, "All day long have I
stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying
generation." If the Lord of mercy has been refused
so long in the sight of you who reverence him, does not
some indignation mingle with your pity, and while you
love sinners and would have them saved, do you not
feel in your heart that there must be an end to such
insulting behavior? I ask even the careless to think of
the matter in this light, and if they do not respect the
ploughman, yet let them have regard to his Master.</p>

<p>And then, again, there are so many <i>other people</i> who
are needing the gospel, and who would receive it if
they had it, that it would seem to be wise to leave
off wearying oneself about those who despise it. What
did our Lord say? He said that if the mighty things
which had been done in Bethsaida and Chorazin had been
done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented.
What is more wonderful still, he says that if he had
wrought the same miracles in Sodom and Gomorrah
which were wrought in Capernaum, they would have
repented in sackcloth and ashes. Does it not occur to
us at once to give the word to those who will have it,
and leave the despisers to perish in their own wilfulness?
Does not reason say, "Let us send this medicine
where there are sick people who will value it?"
Thousands of people are willing to hear the gospel. See
how they crowd wherever the preacher goes&mdash;how they
tread upon one another in their anxiety to listen to
him; and if these people who hear him every day will
not receive his message, "in God's name," saith he,
"let me go where there is a probability of finding soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that can be ploughed." "Shall horses run upon the
rock? Will one plough there with oxen?" Must I
work always where nothing comes of it? Does not
reason say, let the word go to China, to Hindostan, or
to the utmost parts of the earth, where they will receive
it; for those who have it preached in the corners of
their streets despise it?</p>

<p>I shall not lengthen this argument, but shall solemnly
put the question again. Would any of you continue
to pursue an object when it has proved to be hopeless?
Do you wonder that when the Lord has sent his
servants to speak kind, gracious, tender words, and
men have not heard, he says to them, "They are joined
unto their idols; let them alone"? There is a boundary
to the patience of men, and we soon arrive at it;
and assuredly there is a limit, though it is long before
we outrun it, to the patience of God. "At length,"
he says, "it is enough. My Spirit shall no longer
strive with them." If the Lord says this can any of us
complain? Is not this the way of wisdom? Does not
prudence itself dictate it? Any thoughtful mind will
say, "Ay, ay, a rock cannot be ploughed for ever."</p>


<p class="p2">IV. Fourthly. <span class="smcap">There must be an alteration</span>, then,
and that speedily. The oxen shall be taken off from
such toil. It can be easily done, and done soon. It can
be effected in three ways.</p>

<p>First, the unprofitable hearer can be removed so
that he shall no more hear the gospel from the lips of his
best approved minister. There is a preacher who has
some sort of power over him; but as he rejects his
testimony, and remains impenitent, the man shall be
removed to another town, where he shall hear monoto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>nous
discourses which will not touch his conscience. He
shall go where he shall be no longer persuaded and entreated;
and there he will sleep himself into hell. That
may be readily enough done; perhaps some of you are
making arrangements even now for your own removal
from the field of hope.</p>

<p>Another way is to take away the ploughman. He
has done his work as best he could, and he shall be
released from his hopeless task. He is weary. Let him
go home. The soil would not break up, but he could
not help that; let him have his wage. He has broken
his plough at the work; let him go home and hear his
Lord say, "Well done." He was willing to keep on at
the disheartening labor as long as his Master bade him;
but it is evidently useless, therefore let him go home,
for his work is done. He has been sore sick, let him die,
and enter into his rest. This is by no means improbable.</p>

<p>Or, there may happen something else. The Lord
may say, "That piece of work shall never trouble the
ploughman any more. I will take it away." And he
may take it away in this fashion: the man who has
heard the gospel, but rejected it, will die. I pray my
Master that he will not suffer any one of you to die in
your sins, for then we cannot reach you any more, or
indulge the faintest hope for you. No prayer of ours
can follow you into eternity. There is one name by
which you may be saved, and that name is sounded in
your ears&mdash;the name of Jesus; but if you reject him
now, even that name will not save you. If you do not
take Jesus to be your Saviour he will appear as your
judge. I pray you, do not destroy your own souls by
continuing to be obstinate against almighty love.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>God grant that some better thing may happen. Can
nothing else be done? This soil is rock; can we not
sow it without breaking it? No. Without repentance
there is no remission of sin. But is there not a way of
saving men without the grace of God? The Lord Jesus
did not say so; but he said, "He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall
be damned." He did not hint at a middle course or
hold out a "larger hope;" but he declared "He that
believeth not shall be damned," <i>and so he must be</i>.
Dream not of a back door to heaven, for the Lord has
provided none.</p>

<p>What then? Shall the preacher continue his fruitless
toil? If there is only half a hope left him, he is
willing to go on and say, "Hear, ye deaf, and see, ye
blind, and live, ye dead." He will even so speak this
day, for his Master bids him preach the gospel to every
creature; but it will be hard work to repeat the word of
exhortation for years to those who will not hear it.</p>

<p>Happily there is one other turn which affairs may
take. There is a God in heaven, let us pray to him to
put forth his power. Jesus is at his side, let us invoke
his interposition. The Holy Ghost is almighty, let us
call for his aid. Brothers who plough and sisters who
pray, cry to the Master for help. The horse and the
ox evidently fail, but there remains One above who is
able to work great marvels. Did he not once speak to
the rock, and turn the flint into a stream of water?
Let us pray him to do the same now.</p>

<p>And, oh, if there is one who feels and mourns that
his heart is like a piece of rock, I am glad he feels it; for
he who feels that his heart is a rock gives some evidence
that the flint is being transformed. O rock, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
smiting thee, as Moses smote the rock in the wilderness
and erred therein, I would speak to thee. O rock,
wouldst thou become like wax? O rock, wouldst
thou dissolve into rivers of repentance? Hearken to
God's voice! O rock, break with good desire! O
rock, dissolve with longing after Christ, for God is
working upon thee now. Who knows but at this
very moment thou shall begin to crumble down. Dost
thou feel the power of the Word? Does the sharp
ploughshare touch thee just now? Break and break
again, till by contrition thou art dissolved, for then will
the good seed of the gospel come to thee, and thou
shalt receive it into thy bosom, and we shall all behold
the fruit thereof. And so I will fling one more handful
of good corn, and have done. If thou desirest eternal
life, trust Jesus Christ, and thou art saved at once.
"Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the
earth," says Christ, "for I am God, and beside me there
is none else." He that believeth in him hath everlasting
life. "Like as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
have eternal life."</p>

<p>O Lord, break up the rock, and let the seed drop in
among its broken substance, and get thou a harvest
from the dissolved granite, at this time, for Jesus Christ's
sake. Amen.</p>


<h2><a name="THE_PARABLE_OF_THE_SOWER" id="THE_PARABLE_OF_THE_SOWER">THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him
out of every city, he spake by a parable: a sower went out to sow his seed: and
as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trodden down, and the fowls
of the air devoured it. And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was
sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. And some fell
among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it. And other
fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And
when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Luke</span> 8:4-8.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> our country, when a sower goes forth to his
work, he generally enters into an enclosed field, and
scatters the seed from his basket along every ridge and
furrow; but in the East, the corn-growing country, hard
by a small town, is usually an open area. It is divided
into different properties, but there are no visible divisions,
except the ancient landmarks, or perhaps ridges of
stones. Through these open lands there are footpaths,
the most frequented being called the highways. You
must not imagine these highways to be like our macadamized
roads; they are merely paths, trodden tolerably
hard. Here and there you notice by-ways, along which
travellers who wish to avoid the public road may journey
with a little more safety when the main road is
infested with robbers; hasty travellers also strike out
short cuts for themselves, and so open fresh tracks for
others. When the sower goes forth to sow he finds a
plot of ground scratched over with the primitive Eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
plough; he aims at scattering his seed there most plentifully;
but a path runs through the centre of his field,
and unless he is willing to leave a broad headland, he
must throw a handful upon it. Yonder, a rock crops
out in the midst of the ploughed land, and the seed falls
on its shallow soil. Here is a corner full of the roots of
nettles and thistles, and he flings a little here; the corn
and the nettles come up together, and the thorns being
the stronger soon choke the seed, so that it brings forth
no fruit unto perfection. The recollection that the
Bible was written in the East, and that its metaphors
and allusions must be explained to us by Eastern travellers,
will often help us to understand a passage far better
than if we think of English customs.</p>

<p>The preacher of the gospel is like the sower. He
does not make his seed; it is given him by his divine
Master. No man could create the smallest grain that
ever grew upon the earth, much less the celestial seed
of eternal life. The minister goes to his Master in
secret, and asks him to teach him his gospel, and thus
he fills his basket with the good seed of the kingdom.
He then goes forth in his Master's name and scatters
precious truth. If he knew where the best soil was to
be found, perhaps he might limit himself to that which
had been prepared by the plough of conviction; but
not knowing men's hearts, it is his business to preach the
gospel to every creature&mdash;to throw a handful on the
hardened heart, and another on the mind which is overgrown
with the cares and pleasures of the world. He
has to leave the seed in the care of the Lord who gave it
to him, for he is not responsible for the harvest, he is
only accountable for the care and industry with which
he does his work. If no single ear should ever make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
glad the reaper, the sower will be rewarded by his Master
if he had planted the right seed with careful hand.
If it were not for this fact with what despairing agony
should we utter the cry of Esaias, "Who hath believed
our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?"</p>

<p>Our duty is not measured by the character of our
hearers, but by the command of our God. We are
bound to preach the gospel, whether men will hear, or
whether they will forbear. It is ours to sow beside all
waters. Let men's hearts be what they may the minister
must preach the gospel to them; he must sow the seed
on the rock as well as in the furrow, on the highway as
well as in the ploughed field.</p>

<p>I shall now address myself to the four classes of hearers
mentioned in our Lord's parable. We have, first of
all, those who are represented by the <i>way-side</i>, those
who are "hearers only"; then those represented by the
<i>stony ground</i>; these are transiently impressed, but the
word produces no lasting fruit; then, those <i>among
thorns</i>, on whom a good impression is produced, but the
cares of this life, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the
pleasures of the world choke the seed; and lastly, that
small class&mdash;God be pleased to multiply it exceedingly&mdash;that
small class of <i>good ground</i> hearers, in whom the
Word brings forth abundant fruit.</p>


<p class="p2">I. First of all, I address myself to those hearts
which are like the <span class="smcap">way-side</span>: "Some fell by the wayside;
and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air
devoured it." Many of you do not go to the place of
worship desiring a blessing. You do not intend to
worship God, or to be affected by anything that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hear. You are like the highway, which was never intended
to be a cornfield. If a single grain of truth
should fall into your heart and grow it would be as
great a wonder as for corn to grow up in the street. If
the seed shall be dexterously scattered, some of it will
fall upon you, and rest for a while upon your thoughts.
'Tis true you will not understand it; but, nevertheless,
if it be placed before you in an interesting style, you
will talk about it till some more congenial entertainment
shall attract you. Even this slender benefit is
brief, for in a little season you will forget all that you
have heard. Would to God we could hope that our
words would tarry with you; but we cannot hope it, for
the soil of your heart is so hard beaten by continual
traffic, that there is no hope of the seed finding a living
root-hold. Satan is constantly passing over your heart
with his company of blasphemies, lusts, lies, and vanities.
The chariots of pride roll along it, and the feet of
greedy mammon tread it till it is hard as adamant.
Alas! for the good seed, it finds not a moment's respite;
crowds pass and repass; in fact, your soul is an
exchange, across which continually hurry the busy feet
of those who make merchandise of the souls of men.
You are buying and selling, but you little think that
you are selling the truth, and that you are buying your
soul's destruction. You have no time, you say, to think
of religion. No, the road of your heart is such a
crowded thoroughfare, that there is no room for the
wheat to spring up. If it did begin to germinate, some
rough foot would crush the green blade ere it could
come to perfection. The seed has occasionally lain long
enough to begin to sprout, but just then a new place of
amusement has been opened, and you have entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
there, and as with an iron heel, the germ of life that
was in the seed was crushed out. Corn could not grow
in Cornhill or Cheapside, however excellent the seed
might be; your heart is just like those crowded
thoroughfares; for so many cares and sins throng it,
and so many proud, vain, evil, rebellious thoughts
against God pass through it, that the seed of truth cannot
grow.</p>

<p>We have looked at this hard roadside, let us now
describe what becomes of the good word, when it falls
upon such a heart. It would have grown if it had fallen
on right soil, but it has dropped into the wrong place,
and it remains as dry as when it fell from the sower's
hand. The word of the gospel lies upon the surface of
such a heart, but never enters it. Like the snow, which
sometimes falls upon our streets, drops upon the wet
pavement, melts, and is gone at once, so is it with this
man. The word has not time to quicken in his soul;
it lies there an instant, but it never strikes root, or takes
the slightest effect.</p>

<p>Why do men come to hear if the word never enters
their hearts? That has often puzzled us. Some hearers
would not be absent on the Sunday on any account;
they are delighted to come up with us to worship, but
yet the tear never trickles down their cheek, their soul
never mounts up to heaven on the wings of praise, nor
do they truly join in our confessions of sin. They do
not think of the wrath to come, nor of the future state
of their souls. Their heart is as iron; the minister
might as well speak to a heap of stones as preach to
them. What brings these senseless sinners here?
Surely we are as hopeful of converting lions and leopards
as these untamed, insensible hearts. Oh feeling!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their
reason! Do these people come to our assemblies because
it is respectable to attend a place of worship? Or
is it that their coming helps to make them comfortable
in their sins? If they stopped away conscience would
prick them; but they come hither that they may flatter
themselves with the notion that they are religious. Oh!
my hearers, your case is one that might make an angel
weep! How sad to have the sun of the gospel shining
on your faces, and yet to have blind eyes that never see
the light! The music of heaven is lost upon you, for
you have no ears to hear. You can catch the turn of a
phrase, you can appreciate the poetry of an illustration,
but the hidden meaning, the divine life, you do not perceive.
You sit at the marriage-feast, but you eat not of
the dainties; the bells of heaven ring with joy over
ransomed spirits, but you live unransomed, without
God, and without Christ. Though we plead with you,
and pray for you, and weep over you, you still remain
as hardened, as careless, and as thoughtless as ever you
were. May God have mercy on you, and break up your
hard hearts, that his word may abide in you.</p>

<p>We have not, however, completed the picture. The
passage tells us that the fowls of the air devoured the
seed. Is there here a wayside hearer? Perhaps he did
not mean to hear this sermon, and when he has heard it
he will be asked by one of the wicked to come into company.
He will go with the tempter, and the good seed
will be devoured by the fowls of the air. Plenty of evil
ones are ready to take away the gospel from the heart.
The devil himself, that prince of the air, is eager at any
time to snatch away a good thought. And then the
devil is not alone&mdash;he has legions of helpers. He can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
set a man's wife, children, friends, enemies, customers,
or creditors, to eat up the good seed, and they will do
it effectually. Oh, sorrow upon sorrow, that heavenly
seed should become devil's meat; that God's corn
should feed foul birds!</p>

<p>O my hearers, if you have heard the gospel from
your youth, what wagon-loads of sermons have been
wasted on you! In your younger days, you heard old
Dr. So-and-so, and the dear old man was wont to pray
for his hearers till his eyes were red with tears! Do
you recollect those many Sundays when you said to
yourself, "Let me go to my chamber and fall on my
knees and pray"? But you did not; the fowls of the
air ate up the seed, and you went on to sin as you had
sinned before. Since then, by some strange impulse,
you are very rarely absent from God's house; but now
the seed of the gospel falls into your soul as if it
dropped upon an iron floor, and nothing comes of it.
The law may be thundered at you; you do not sneer at
it, but it never affects you. Jesus Christ may be lifted
up; his dear wounds may be exhibited; his streaming
blood may flow before your very eyes, and you may be
bidden with all earnestness to look to him and live;
but it is as if one should sow the sea-shore. What shall
I do for you? Shall I stand here and rain tears upon
this hard highway? Alas! my tears will not break it
up; it is trodden too hard for that. Shall I bring the
gospel plough? Alas! the ploughshare will not enter
ground so solid. What shall we do? O God, thou
knowest how to melt the hardest heart with the precious
blood of Jesus. Do it now, we beseech thee, and thus
magnify thy grace, by causing the good seed to live, and
to produce a heavenly harvest.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">II. I shall now turn to the second class of hearers:
"And some fell upon a <span class="smcap">rock</span>; and as soon as it was
sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture."
You can easily picture to yourselves that piece
of rock in the midst of the field thinly veiled with soil;
and of course the seed falls there as it does everywhere
else. It springs up, it hastens to grow, it withers, it
dies. None but those who love the souls of men can
tell what hopes, what joys, and what bitter disappointments
these stony places have caused us. We have a
class of hearers whose hearts are hard, and yet they are
apparently the softest and most impressible of men.
While other men see nothing in the sermon, these men
weep. Whether you preach the terrors of the law or
the love of Calvary, they are alike stirred in their souls,
and the liveliest impressions are apparently produced.
Such may be listening now. They have resolved, but
they have procrastinated. They are not the sturdy enemies
of God who clothe themselves in steel, but they
seem to bare their breasts, and lay them open to the
minister. Rejoiced in heart, we shoot our arrows there,
and they appear to penetrate; but, alas, a secret armor
blunts every dart, and no wound is felt. The parable
speaks of this character thus: "Some fell upon stony
places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith
they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth."
Or as another passage explains it: "And these are
they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who,
when they have heard the word, immediately receive it
with gladness; and have no root in themselves, and so
endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or
persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately
they are offended." Have we not thousands of hearers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
who receive the word with joy? They have no deep
convictions, but they leap into Christ on a sudden, and
profess an instantaneous faith in him, and that faith has
all the appearance of being genuine. When we look at
it, the seed has really sprouted. There is a kind of life
in it, there is apparently a green blade. We thank God
that a sinner is brought back, a soul is born to God.
But our joy is premature; they sprang up on a sudden,
and received the word with joy, because they had no
depth of earth, and the self-same cause which hastened
their reception of the seed also causes them, when the
sun is risen with his fervent heat, to wither away.
These men we see every day in the week. They come
to join the church; they tell us a story of how they
heard us preach on such-and-such an occasion, and, oh,
the word was so blessed to them, they never felt so
happy in their lives! "Oh, sir, I thought I must leap
from my seat when I heard about a precious Christ, and
I believed on him there and then; I am sure I did."
We question them as to whether they were ever convinced
of sin. They think they were; but one thing
they know, they feel a great pleasure in religion. We
put it to them. "Do you think you will hold on?"
They are confident that they shall. They hate the
things they once loved, they are sure they do. Everything
has become new to them. And all this is on a
sudden. We enquire when the good work began. We
find it began when it ended, that is to say, there was no
previous work, no ploughing of the soil, but on a sudden
they sprang from death to life, as if a field should
be covered with wheat by magic. Perhaps we receive
them into the church; but in a week or two they are
not so regular as they used to be. We gently reprove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
them, and they explain that they meet with such opposition
in religion that they are obliged to yield a little.
Another month and we lose them altogether. The reason
is that they have been laughed at or exposed to a
little opposition, and they have gone back. And what,
think you, are the feelings of the minister? He is like
the husbandman, who sees his field all green and flourishing,
but at night a frost nips every shoot, and his
hoped-for gains are gone. The minister goes to his
chamber, and casts himself on his face before God, and
cries, "I have been deceived; my converts are fickle,
their religion has withered as the green herb." In the
ancient story Orpheus is said to have had such skill
upon the lyre, that he made the oaks and stones to
dance around him. It is a poetical fiction, and yet hath
it sometimes happened to the minister, that not only
have the godly rejoiced, but men, like oaks and stones,
have danced from their places. Alas! they have been
oaks and stones still. Hushed is the lyre. The oak
returns to its rooting-place, and the stone casts itself
heavily to the earth. The sinner, who, like Saul, was
among the prophets, goes back to plan mischief against
the Most High.</p>

<p>If it is bad to be a wayside hearer, I cannot think it
is much better to be like the rock. This second class of
hearers certainly gives us more joy than the first. A
certain company always comes round a new minister;
and I have often thought it is an act of God's kindness
that he allows these people to gather at the first, while
the minister is young, and has but few to stand by him;
these persons are easily moved, and if the minister
preaches earnestly they feel it, and they love him, and
rally round him, much to his comfort. But time, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
proves all things, proves them. They seemed to be
made of true metal; but when they are put into the
fire to be tested, they are consumed in the furnace.
Some of the shallow kind are here now. I have looked
at you when I have been preaching, and I have often
thought, "That man one of these days will come out
from the world, I am sure he will." I have thanked
God for him. Alas, he is the same as ever. Years and
years have we sowed him in vain, and it is to be feared
it will be so to the end, for he is without depth, and
without the moisture of the Spirit. Shall it be so?
Must I stand over the mouth of your open sepulchre,
and think, "Here lies a shoot which never became an
ear, a man in whom grace struggled but never reigned,
who gave some hopeful spasms of life and then subsided
into eternal death?" God save you! Oh! may the
Spirit deal with you effectually, and may you, even
you, yet bring forth fruit unto God, that Jesus may
have a reward for his sufferings.</p>


<p class="p2">III. I shall briefly treat of the third class, and may
the Spirit of God assist me to deal faithfully with you.
"And some fell among <span class="smcap">thorns</span>; and the thorns sprang
up with it, and choked it." Now, this was good soil.
The two first characters were bad; the wayside was not
the proper place, the rock was not a congenial situation
for the growth of any plant; but this is good soil, for
it grows thorns. Wherever a thistle will spring up and
flourish, there would wheat flourish too. This was fat,
fertile soil; it was no marvel therefore that the husbandman
dealt largely there, and threw handful after handful
upon that corner of the field. See how happy he
is when in a month or two he visits the spot. The seed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
has sprung up. True, there's a suspicious little plant
down there of about the same size as the wheat. "Oh!"
he thinks, "that's not much, the corn will outgrow <i>that</i>.
When it is stronger it will choke these few thistles that
have unfortunately mixed with it." Ay, Mr. Husbandman,
you do not understand the force of evil, or you
would not thus dream! He comes again, and the seed
has grown, there is even the corn in the ear; but the
thistles, the thorns, and the briers have become inter-twisted
with one another, and the poor wheat can hardly
get a ray of sunshine. It is so choked with thorns
every way, that it looks quite yellow; the plant is
starved. Still it perseveres in growing, and it does seem
as if it would bring forth a little fruit. Alas, it never
comes to anything. With it the reaper never fills his arm.</p>

<p>We have this class very largely among us. These
hear the word and understand what they hear. They
take the truth home; they think it over; they even go
the length of making a profession of religion. The
wheat seems to spring and ear; it will soon come to
perfection. Be in no hurry, these men and women have
a great deal to see after; they have the cares of a large
concern; their establishment employs so many hundred
hands; do not be deceived as to their godliness&mdash;they
have no time for it. They will tell you that they must
live; that they cannot neglect this world; that they
must anyhow look out for the present, and as for the
future, they will render it all due attention by-and-by.
They continue to attend gospel-preaching, and the poor
little stunted blade of religion keeps on growing after a
fashion. Meanwhile they have grown rich, they come
to the place of worship in a carriage, they have all that
heart can wish. Ah! now the seed will grow, will it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
not? No, no. They have no cares now; the shop is
given up, they live in the country; they have not to
ask, "Where shall the money come from to meet the
next bill?" or "how shall they be able to provide for
an increasing family." Now they have too much instead
of too little, for they have <i>riches</i>, and they are too
wealthy to be gracious. "But," says one, "they might
spend their riches for God." Certainly they might, but
they do not, for riches are deceitful. They have to
entertain much company, and chime in with the world,
and so Christ and his church are left in the lurch.</p>

<p>Yes, but they begin to spend their riches, and they
have surely got over that difficulty, for they give largely
to the cause of Christ, and they are munificent in
charity; the little blade will grow, will it not? No, for
now behold the thorns of pleasure. Their liberality to
others involves liberality to themselves; their pleasures,
amusements, and vanities choke the wheat of true religion;
the good grains of gospel truth cannot grow because
they have to attend that musical party, that ball,
and that soirée, and so they cannot think of the things
of God. I know several specimens of this class. I knew
one, high in court circles, who has confessed to me that
he wished he were poor, for then he might enter the
kingdom of heaven. He has said to me, "Ah! sir, these
politics, these politics, I wish I were rid of them, they
are eating the life out of my heart. I cannot serve God
as I would." I know of another, overloaded with riches,
who has said to me, "Ah! sir, it is an awful thing to be
rich; one cannot keep close to the Saviour with all this
earth about him."</p>

<p>Ah! my dear readers, I will not ask for you that God
may lay you on a bed of sickness, that he may strip you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of all your wealth, and bring you to beggary; but, oh,
if he were to do it, and you were to save your souls, it
would be the best bargain you could ever make. If
those mighty ones who now complain that the thorns
choke the seed could give up all their riches and pleasures,
if they that fare sumptuously every day could take
the place of Lazarus at the gate, it were a happy change
for them if their souls might be saved. A man may be
honorable and rich, and yet go to heaven; but it will be
hard work, for "It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into
the kingdom of heaven." God does make some rich
men enter the kingdom of heaven, but hard is their
struggle. Steady, young man, steady! Hurry not to
climb to wealth! It is a place where many heads are
turned. Do not ask God to make you popular; they
that have popularity are wearied by it. Cry with Agur,
"Give me neither poverty nor riches." God give
me to tread the golden mean, and may I ever have in
my heart that good seed, which shall bring forth fruit a
hundredfold to his own glory.</p>


<p class="p2">IV. I now close with the last character, namely,
the <span class="smcap">good ground</span>. Of the good soil, as you will mark,
we have but one in four. Will one in four of our hearers,
with well-prepared heart, receive the Word?</p>

<p>The ground is described as "good"; not that it
was good by nature, but it had been made good by
grace. God had ploughed it; he had stirred it up with
the plough of conviction, and there it lay in ridge and
furrow as it should lie. When the gospel was preached,
the heart received it, for the man said, "That is just
the blessing I want. Mercy is what a needy sinner re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>quires."
So that the preaching of the gospel was <span class="smcap">the</span>
thing to give comfort to this disturbed and ploughed
soil. Down fell the seed to take good root. In some
cases it produced fervency of love, largeness of heart,
devotedness of purpose of a noble kind, like seed which
produces a hundredfold. The man became a mighty
servant for God, he spent himself and was spent. He
took his place in the vanguard of Christ's army, stood in
the hottest of the battle, and did deeds of daring which
few could accomplish&mdash;the seed produced a hundredfold.
It fell into another heart of like character; the
man could not do the most, but still he did much. He
gave himself to God, and in his business he had a word
to say for his Lord; in his daily walk he quietly
adorned the doctrine of God his Saviour&mdash;he brought
forth sixtyfold. Then it fell on another, whose abilities
and talents were but small; he could not be a star, but
he would be a glow-worm; he could not do as the greatest,
but he was content to do something, however humble.
The seed had brought forth in him tenfold, perhaps
twentyfold. How many are there of this sort here? Is
there one who prays within himself, "God be merciful
to me a sinner"? The seed has fallen in the right spot.
Soul, thy prayer shall be heard. God never sets a man
longing for mercy without intending to give it. Does
another whisper, "Oh that I might be saved"? Believe
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou, even thou, shalt be
saved. Hast thou been the chief of sinners? Trust
Christ, and thy enormous sins shall vanish as the millstone
sinks beneath the flood. Is there no one here that
will trust the Saviour? Can it be possible that the
Spirit is entirely absent? that he is not moving in one
soul? not begetting life in one spirit? We will pray that
he may now descend, that the word may not be in vain.</p>



<h2><a name="THE_PRINCIPAL_WHEAT" id="THE_PRINCIPAL_WHEAT">THE PRINCIPAL WHEAT.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"The principal wheat."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> 28:25.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> prophet mentions it as a matter of wisdom on
the part of the husbandman, that <span class="smcap">he knows what is the
principal thing to cultivate</span>, and makes it his principal
care. The text, with the connection, runs thus:
"Does not the husbandman cast in the principal
wheat?" He does not go to the granary and take out
wheat, and cummin, and barley, and rye, and fling these
about right and left, but he estimates the value of each
grain, and arranges them in his mind accordingly. He
does not think that cummin and caraway, which he
merely grows to give a flavor to his meal, are of half
such importance as his bread-corn; and, though rye
and barley have their values, yet he does not reckon that
even these are equal to what he calls "the principal
wheat." He is a man of discretion, he arranges things;
he places the most important crop in the front rank,
and spends upon it the most care.</p>

<p>Here let us learn a lesson. Do keep things distinct
in your minds&mdash;not huddled and muddled by a careless
thoughtlessness. Do not live a confused life, without
care and discretion, running all things into one; but
sort things out, and divide and distinguish between the
precious and the vile. See what this is worth, and what
the other is worth, and set your matters in rank and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
order, making some of them principal, and others of
them inferior. I suggest to you young people especially
that, in starting life, you say to yourselves, "What
shall we live for? There is a principal thing for which
we ought to live, what shall it be?" Have you turned
over that question, or have you gone at it hit or miss?
What are you living for? What is your principal aim?
Is it going to be that of the old gentleman in Horace
who said to his boy, "Get money: get it honestly, if
you can; but, by all means, get money." Will you be
a money-spinner? Shall coin be your principal corn?
Or will you choose a life of pleasure&mdash;"a short life and
a merry one," as so many fools have said to their great
sorrow? Is it in dissipation that your life is to be
spent? Are thistles to be your principal crop? Because
there is a pleasure in looking at a Scotch thistle,
do you intend to grow acres of pleasurable vice? And
will you make your bed upon them when you come to
die? Search and see what is worthy of being the principal
object in life; and, when you have found it out,
then beseech the Holy Spirit to help you to choose that
one thing, and to give all your powers and faculties to
the cultivation of it. The farmer, who finds that wheat
ought to be his principal crop, makes it so, and lays
himself out with that end in view; learn from this to
have a main object, and to give your whole mind to it.</p>

<p>This farmer was wise, because <i>he counted that to be
principal which was the most needful</i>. His family could do
without cummin, which was but a flavoring. Perhaps
the mistress might complain, or the cook might grumble,
but that did not signify so much as it would do if
the children cried for bread. They certainly must have
wheat, for bread is the staff of life. It is bread that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
strengtheneth man's heart, and therefore the farmer
must grow wheat if he does not grow anything else.
That which is necessary he regarded as the principal
thing. Is not this common sense? If we were wisely
to sit down and estimate, should we not say, "To be
forgiven my sins, to be right with God, to be holy, to
be fit to live eternally in heaven, is the greatest, the
most needful thing for me, and therefore I will make it
the principal object of my pursuit"? A creature cannot
be satisfied unless he is answering the end for which he
is created; and the end of every intelligent creature is
first, to glorify God, and next, to enjoy God. What a
bliss it must be to enjoy God himself for ever and ever!
Other things may be desirable, but this thing is needful.
A competence of income, a measure of esteem
among men, a degree of health&mdash;all these are the flavoring
of life, but to be saved in the Lord with an everlasting
salvation is life itself. Jesus Christ is the bread by
which our soul's best life is sustained. Oh, that we
were all wise enough to feel that to be one with Christ
is the one thing needful; that to be at peace with God
is the principal thing; that to be brought into harmony
with the Most High is the true music of our being.
Other herbs may take their place in due order, but
grace is the principal wheat, and we must cultivate it.</p>

<p>This farmer was wise, because <i>he made that to be the
principal thing which was the most fit to be so</i>. Of course,
barley is useful as food, for nations have lived on barley
bread, and lived healthily too; and rye has been the
nutriment of millions; neither have they starved on
oats and other grains. Still, give me a piece of wheaten
bread, for it is the best staff for life's journey. This
farmer knew that wheat was the most fitting food for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
man, and so he did not put the inferior grain, which
might act as a substitute, into the prominent place; but
he gave his wheat the preference. He did not say,
"the principal barley," or "the principal rye," much
less "the principal cummin," or "the principal
fitches," but "the principal wheat."</p>

<p>And what is there, brethren, that is so fit for the
heart, the mind, the soul of man, as to know God and
his Christ? Other mental foods, such as the fruits of
knowledge, and the dainties of science, excellent
though they may be&mdash;are inferior nutriment and unsuitable
to build up the inner manhood. In my God and
my Saviour, I find my heaven and my all. My soul sits
down to a crumb of truth about Jesus, and finds great
satisfaction in living upon it. The more we can know
God, and enjoy God, and become like to God, and the
more Christ is our daily bread, the more do we perceive
the fitness of all this to our new-born natures. O beloved,
make that to be your principal object which is
the fittest pursuit of an immortal mind.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"Religion is the chief concern</div>

</div>
   </div>
</div>



<p>Moreover, this farmer was wise, because <i>he made
that the principal thing which was the most profitable</i>. Under
certain circumstances, in our own country, wheat is not
the most profitable thing which a man can grow; but,
ordinarily, it is the best crop that the earth yields, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
therefore the text speaks of "the principal wheat."
Our grandfathers used to rely upon the wheat stack to
pay their rent. They looked to their corn as the arm
of their strength; and though it is not so now, it always
was so of old, and perhaps it may yet be so again.
Anyhow, the figure holds good with regard to true religion.
That is the most profitable thing. I am told
that rich men find it very hard to get hold of anything
which yields five per cent, nowadays; but this blessed
fear of the Lord is an extraordinarily profitable investment,
for it does not yield a hundred per cent, or a
thousand per cent, but a man begins with nothing and
all things become his by faith. Being freely discharged
of our sins, we are by overflowing grace greatly enriched,
so that we number among our possessions heaven
itself, Christ himself, God himself. All things are ours.
Oh, what a blessed crop to sow! What a harvest comes
of it! Godliness is profitable for the life that now is,
and for that which is to come. Godliness is a blessing
to a man's body, it keeps him from drunkenness and
vice; and it is a blessing to his soul, it makes him sweet
and pure. It is a blessing to him every way. If I had
to die like a dog, I would like to live like a Christian.
If there were no hereafter, yet still, for comfort and for
joy, give me the life of one who strives to live like
Christ. There is a practical everyday truth in the
verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"'Tis religion that can give</div>
<div class="line ip5 small">Sweetest pleasures while we live;</div>
<div class="line ip5 small">'Tis religion must supply</div>
<div class="line ip5 small">Solid comfort when we die."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Only that religion must not be of the common sort; it
must have for its root a hearty faith in Jesus Christ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
See ye to it. Our religion must be either everything or
nothing, either first or nowhere. Make it "the principal
wheat," and it will richly repay you.</p>


<p class="p2">II. Secondly, the husbandman is a lesson to us
because <span class="smcap">he gives this principal thing the principal
place</span>. I find that the Hebrew is rendered by some
eminent scholars, "He puts the wheat into the principal
place." That little handful of cummin for the wife to
flavor the cakes with he grows in a corner; and the
various herbs he places in their proper borders. The
barley he sets in its plot, and the rye in its acre; but
if there is a good bit of rich soil&mdash;the best he has&mdash;he
appropriates it to the principal wheat. He gives his
choicest fields to that which is to be the main means of
his living.</p>

<p>Now, here is a lesson for you and for me. Let us
give to true godliness our principal powers and abilities.
Let us give to the things of God our best and
<i>most intense thought</i>. I pray you, do not take religion at
second hand from what I tell you, or from what somebody
else tells you; but think it over. Read, mark,
learn, and inwardly digest the word of God. The
thoughtful Christian is the growing Christian. Remember,
the service of God deserves our first consideration
and endeavor. We are poor things at our prime,
but we ought to give the Lord nothing short of our
best. God would not have us serve him heedlessly, but
he would have us use all the brain and intellect and
mind that we have in studying and practising his word.
"Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace."
"Meditate upon these things. Give thyself wholly to
them." If your mind is more clear and active at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
time than at another, then sow the principal wheat. If
you feel more fresh and more inclined to think at one
time of the day than at another, let your mind then go
towards the best things.</p>

<p>Be sure, also, to yield to this subject <i>your most earnest
love</i>. The best field in the little estate of manhood is
not the head, but the heart; sow the principal wheat
there. Oh, to have true religion in the heart; to love
what we know&mdash;intensely to love it; to hold it fast as
with the grip of life and death&mdash;never to let it go! The
Lord says, "My son, give me thy heart," and he will
not be contented with anything less than our heart.
Oh, when your zeal is most burning, and your love is
most fervent, let the warmth and the fervency all go
towards the Lord your God, and to the service of him
who has redeemed you with his precious blood. Let
the principal wheat have the principal part of your
nature. Towards God and his Christ also turn your
<i>most fervent desires</i>. When you enlarge your desire, desire
Christ; when you become ambitious let your ambition
be all for God. Let your hunger and your thirst
be after righteousness. Let your aspirations and your
longings be all towards holiness, and the things that
shall make you like to Christ. Give to this principal
wheat your principal desires.</p>

<p>Then let the Lord have <i>the attentive respect of your life</i>.
Let the principal wheat be sown in every action. If we
are truly Christians we must be as much Christians outside
the church as in it. We shall try to make our eating
and our drinking, and everything we do, tend to
the glory of God. Draw no line between the secular
and the religious part of your conduct, but let the secular
be made religious by a devout desire to glorify God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in the one as much as in the other. Let us worship God
in the commonest duties of life, even as they do who
stand before his throne. So it ought to be. Let us sow
the principal wheat in all the fields of our conversation,
in business, in the family, among our friends, and with
our children. May we each one feel, "For me to live is
Christ. I cannot live without Christ, or for anything
but Christ." Let your whole nature yield itself to
Jesus, and to none else.</p>

<p>We should give to this principal wheat <i>our most
earnest labors</i>. We should spend ourselves for the spread
of the gospel. A Christian man ought to lay himself
out to serve Jesus. I hate to see a professing man zealous
in politics and lukewarm in devotion; all on fire at
a parish vestry, and chill as winter when he comes to a
prayer-meeting. Some fly like eagles when they are
serving the world, but they have a broken wing in the
service of God. This should not be. If anything could
rouse us up, and make the lion within us roar in his
strength, it should be when we confront the foes of
Jesus or fight in his cause. Our Lord's service is the
principal wheat, let us labor most in connection with it.</p>

<p>This, I think, should also take possession of us so
as to lead to <i>our greatest sacrifices</i>. The love of Christ
ought to be so strong as to swallow up self, and make
sacrifice our daily joy. For Christ's name's sake we
should be willing to endure poverty, reproach, slander,
exile, death. Nothing should be dear to a Christian in
comparison with Christ. Now, I will put it to you
whether it is so or no. Is the love of Jesus the principal
wheat with us? Are we giving our religion the chief
place or not? I am afraid some people treat religion
as certain gentlemen treat an off-hand farm; they put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
a bailiff into it, and only give an eye to it now and then.
Their minister is the bailiff, and they expect him to see
to it for them. These off-hand farms are losing concerns.
Look at these half-and-half brethren. They
have religion? Certainly. But they are like the man
of whom the child spoke at the Sunday-school. "Is
your father a Christian?" said the teacher. "Yes," said
the child, "but he has not worked much at it lately."
I could point out several of this sort, who are sowing
their wheat very sparingly, and choosing the most barren
patch to sow it in. They profess to be Christians,
but religion is a tenth-rate article on their farm. Some
have a large acreage for the world, and a poor little plot
for Christ. They are growers of worldly pleasure and
self-indulgence, and they sow a little religion by the
roadside for appearance sake. This will not do. God
will not thus be mocked. If we despise him and his
truth we shall be lightly esteemed. O come let us give
our principal time, talent, thought, effort to that which
is the chief concern of immortal spirits. May we imitate
the husbandman who gives the principal wheat the
principal place in his farm.</p>


<p class="p2">III. Let us learn a third lesson. <span class="smcap">The husbandman
selects the principal seed-corn when he is sowing his
wheat.</span> When a farmer is setting aside wheat for sowing,
he does not choose the tail corn and the worst of
his produce, but if he is a sensible man he likes to sow
the best wheat in the world. Many farmers search the
country round for a good sample of wheat for sowing,
for they do not expect to get a good harvest out of bad
seed. The husbandman is taught of God to put into
the ground "the principal wheat." Let me learn that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
if I am going to sow to the Lord and to be a Christian,
I should sow the best kind of Christianity.</p>

<p>I should try to do this, first, <i>by believing the weightiest
doctrines</i>. I would believe not this "ism," nor that, but
the unadulterated truth which Jesus taught; for a holy
character will only grow by the Spirit of God out of
true doctrine. Falsehood breeds sin: truth begets and
fosters holiness. You and I therefore ought to select
our seed carefully, and cast out all error. If we are
wise we shall think most of the most important truths,
for I have known people attach the greatest importance
to the smallest things. They fight over the fitches, and
leave the wheat to the crows. As for me, those who
will may dispute over vials and trumpets, I shall mainly
preach the doctrine of the precious blood and the glorious
truths of substitution and atonement. These doctrines
are the principal wheat, and therefore these shall
have my choice.</p>

<p>Next to that, we ought to sow <i>the noblest examples</i>.
Many men are dwarfed because they choose a bad model
to start with. They imitate dear old Mr. So-and-so till
they grow wonderfully like him with the best of him
left out. A minister happens to be of a gloomy turn of
mind, and he preaches the deep experience of the children
of God, and in consequence a band of good people
think it their duty to be melancholy. Why need they
fall into a ditch because their leader has splashed himself?
We should never copy any man's infirmities. To
be like Paul there is no need to have weak eyes; to be
like Thomas there is no necessity to doubt. If you
copy any good man, there is a point at which you
ought to stop short. If I must have a human model, I
would prefer one of the bravest of the saints of God;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
but oh how much better to follow that perfect pattern
which you have in Christ Jesus!</p>

<p>We should sow the best wheat by seeing that we
have <i>the purest spirit</i>. Alas! how soon do spirits become
soiled by self or pride, or despondency or sloth, or
some earthly taint. But what a grand thing it is to live
in the spirit of Christ! May we be humble, lowly, bold,
self-sacrificing, pure, chaste, and holy.</p>

<p>And, then, there is one more mode of sowing selected
seed. We should endeavor to live in <i>the closest communion
with God</i>. A dear brother prayed just now that
we might have as much grace as we were capable of receiving,
and that God would bring us into such a state
that we might not hinder him in anything which he
willed to do by us. This is a good prayer. It should
be our desire to rise to the highest form of spiritual life.
If you sow this principal wheat, get the best sort of it.
There is a spirit and a spirit; and there are doctrines
and doctrines; the best is the best for you. O young
men, if you mean to have piety, go in for it thoroughly.
Do not sneak through the world as if you were ashamed
of your Lord. If you are Christ's, show your colors.
Rally to his banner, gather to his trumpet call, and then
stand up, stand up for Jesus. If there is any manhood
in you, this great cause calls for it all; exhibit it, and
may the Spirit of God help you so to do.</p>


<p class="p2">IV. Fourthly, <span class="smcap">the husbandman grows the principal
wheat with the principal care</span>. Some critics say
that the proper translation is that the husbandman
plants his wheat in rows. It is said that the large crops
in Palestine in olden time were due to the fact that they
planted the wheat. They set it in lines, so that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
not checked or suffocated by its being too thick in one
place, neither was there any fear of its being too thin in
another. The wheat was planted, and then streams of
water were turned by the foot to each particular plant.
No wonder, therefore, that the land brought forth
abundantly.</p>

<p>We should give our principal care to the principal
thing. Our godliness should be carried out with discretion
and care. Brethren, are we careful enough as
to our religious walk? Have you ever searched to the
bottom of your profession? Why do you happen to be
members of a certain church? Your mother was so.
Well, there is some good in that reason, but not enough
to justify you in the sight of God. I pray you judge
your standing. If any Christian minister is afraid to
urge you to this duty, I stand in doubt of him. I am not
at all afraid. I beg you to examine all that I teach you,
for I would not like to be responsible for another man's
creed. Like the Bereans, search and see whether these
things be according to Scripture or not. One of the
greatest blessings that could come upon the church
would be a searching spirit which would refer everything
to the Holy Scriptures. If they speak not according
to this word it is because there is no light in them.
Do your service to God as carefully as the eastern
farmer planted his wheat, when he set it in rows with
great orderliness and exactness. You serve a precise
God, therefore serve him precisely. He is a jealous
God, therefore be jealous of the least taint of error or
will-worship.</p>

<p>Take care, also, that you water every part of your
religion, as the farmer watered each plant. Pray for
grace from on high that you may never be parched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
dried up. Perform to your faith, to your hope, to your
love, and to all the plants that are in your soul every
other service which the husbandman renders to his
wheat. Give grace your principal care, for it deserves
it.</p>


<p class="p2">V. With this I close. Do this, because <span class="smcap">from this
you may expect your principal crop</span>. If religion be
the principal thing, you may look to religion for your
principal reward. The harvest will come to you in
various ways. You will make the greatest success in
this life if you wholly live to the glory of God. Success
or failure must much depend upon the fitness of our
object. It is of no use <i>my</i> attempting to sing, for I shall
never be able to conduct a choir. I could not succeed
in that, but if I preach, I may succeed, for that is my
work. Now you, Christian man, if you try to live to
the world you will not prosper, for you are not fitted
for it. Grace has spoiled you for sin. If you live to
God with all your heart you will succeed in it, for God
has made you on purpose for it. As he made the fish
for the water, and the birds for the air, so he made the
believer for holiness, and for the service of God; and
you will be out of your element, a fish out of water, or
a bird in the stream, if you leave the service of God.
The Eastern farmer's prosperity hinges on his wheat,
and yours upon your devotion to God. It is to Godliness
that you must look for your joy. Is there any bliss
like the bliss of knowing that you are in Christ, and are
the beloved of the Lord? It is to your religion that
you must look for comfort on a sick and dying bed, and
you may be there very soon.</p>

<p>In the world to come what a crop, what a harvest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
will come of serving the Lord! What will come out of
all else? What but mere smoke? A man has made a
million of money, and he is dead. What has he got by
his wealth? A man's fame rings throughout the earth
as a great and successful warrior, and he is dead. What
has he as the result of all his honors? To live to the
world is like playing with boys in the street for halfpence,
or with babes for bits of platter and oyster shells.
Life for God is real and substantial, but all else is
waste. Let us think so, and gird up our loins to serve
the Lord. May the divine Spirit help us to sow "the
principal wheat," and to live in joyful expectation of
reaping a happy harvest according to the promise,
"They that sow in tears shall reap in joy."</p>


<h2><a name="SPRING_IN_THE_HEART" id="SPRING_IN_THE_HEART">SPRING IN THE HEART.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows
thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span>
65:10.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Though</span> other seasons excel in fulness, spring must
always bear the palm for freshness and beauty. We
thank God when the harvest hours draw near, and the
golden grain invites the sickle, but we ought equally to
thank him for the rougher days of spring, for these prepare
the harvest. April showers are mothers of the
sweet May flowers, and the wet and cold of winter are
the parents of the splendor of summer. God blesses
the springing thereof, or else it could not be said,
"Thou crownest the year with thy goodness." There
is as much necessity for divine benediction in spring as
for heavenly bounty in summer; and, therefore, we
should praise God all the year round.</p>

<p>Spiritual spring is a very blessed season in a church.
Then we see youthful piety developed, and on every hand
we hear the joyful cry of those who say, "We have
found the Lord." Our sons are springing up as the
grass and as willows by the water-courses. We hold up
our hands in glad astonishment and cry, "Who are
these that fly as a cloud and as doves to their windows?"
In the revival days of a Church, when God is
blessing her with many conversions, she has great cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to rejoice in God and to sing, "Thou blessest the
springing thereof."</p>

<p>I intend to take the text in reference to individual
cases. There is a time of springing of grace, when it is
just in its bud, just breaking through the dull cold earth
of unregenerate nature. I desire to talk a little about
that, and concerning the blessing which the Lord grants
to the green blade of new-born godliness, to those who
are beginning to hope in the Lord.</p>


<p class="p2">I. First, I shall have a little to say about <span class="smcap">the
work previous to the springing thereof</span>.</p>

<p>It appears from the text that there is work for God
alone to do before the springing comes, and we know
that there is work for God to do through us as well.</p>

<p><i>There is work for us to do.</i> Before there can be a
springing up in the soul of any, there must be <i>ploughing</i>,
harrowing, and sowing. There must be a ploughing,
and we do not expect that as soon as ever we plough
we shall reap the sheaves. Blessed be God, in many
cases, the reaper overtakes the ploughman, but we must
not always expect it. In some hearts God is long in
preparing the soul by conviction: the law with its ten
black horses drags the ploughshare of conviction up and
down the soul till there is no one part of it left unfurrowed.
Conviction goes deeper than any plough to the
very core and centre of the spirit, till the spirit is
wounded. The ploughers make deep furrows indeed
when God puts his hand to the work: the soil of the
heart is broken in pieces in the presence of the Most
High.</p>

<p>Then comes the <i>sowing</i>. Before there can be a
springing up it is certain that there must be something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
put into the ground, so that after the preacher has used
the plough of the law, he applies to his Master for the
seed-basket of the gospel. Gospel promises, gospel doctrines,
especially a clear exposition of free grace and the
atonement, these are the handfuls of corn which we
scatter broadcast. Some of the grain falls on the highway,
and is lost; but other handfuls fall where the
plough has been, and there abide.</p>

<p>Then comes the <i>harrowing</i> work. We do not expect
to sow seed and then leave it: the gospel has to be
prayed over. The prayer of the preacher and the
prayer of the Church make up God's harrow to rake in
the seed after it is scattered, and so it is covered up
within the clods of the soul, and is hidden in the heart
of the hearer.</p>

<p>Now there is a reason why I dwell upon this, namely,
that I may exhort my dear brethren who have not
seen success, not to give up the work, but to hope that
they have been doing the ploughing, and sowing, and
harrowing work, and that the harvest is to come. I
mention this for yet another reason, and that is, by way
of warning to those who expect to have a harvest without
this preparatory work. I do not believe that much
good will come from attempts at sudden revivals made
without previous prayerful labor. A revival to be permanent
must be a matter of growth, and the result of
much holy effort, longing, pleading, and watching.
The servant of God is to preach the gospel whether men
are prepared for it or not; but in order to large success,
depend upon it there is a preparedness necessary among
the hearers. Upon some hearts warm earnest preaching
drops like an unusual thing which startles but does
not convince; while in other congregations, where good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
gospel preaching has long been the rule, and much
prayer has been offered, the words fall into the hearers'
souls and bring forth speedy fruit. We must not expect
to have results without work. There is no hope of a
church having an extensive revival in its midst unless
there is continued and importunate waiting upon God,
together with earnest laboring, intense anxiety, and
hopeful expectation.</p>

<p><i>But there is also a work to be done which is beyond our
power.</i> After ploughing, sowing, and harrowing, there
must come the shower from heaven. "Thou visitest
the earth and waterest it," says the Psalmist. In vain
are all our efforts unless God shall bless us with the
rain of his Holy Spirit's influence. O Holy Spirit! thou,
and thou alone, workest wonders in the human heart,
and thou comest from the Father and the Son to do the
Father's purposes, and to glorify the Son.</p>

<p>Three effects are spoken of. First, we are told <i>he
waters the ridges</i>. As the ridges of the field become well
saturated through and through with the abundant rain,
so God sends his Holy Spirit till the whole heart of man
is moved and influenced by his divine operations. The
understanding is enlightened, the conscience is quickened,
the will is controlled, the affections are inflamed;
all these powers, which I may call the ridges of the
heart, come under the divine working. It is ours to
deal with men as men, and bring to bear upon them
gospel truth, and to set before them motives that are
suitable to move rational creatures; but, after all, it is
the rain from on high which alone can water the ridges:
there is no hope of the heart being savingly affected except
by divine operations.</p>

<p>Next, it is added, "<i>Thou settlest the furrows</i>," by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
which some think it is meant that the furrows are
drenched with water. Others think there is an allusion
here to the beating down of the earth by heavy rain till
the ridges become flat, and by the soaking of the water
are settled into a more compact mass. Certain it is that
the influences of God's Spirit have a humbling and
settling effect upon a man. He was unsettled once like
the earth that is dry and crumbly, and blown about and
carried away with every wind of doctrine; but as the
earth when soaked with wet is compacted and knit together,
so the heart becomes solid and serious under the
power of the Spirit. As the high parts of the ridge are
beaten down into the furrows, so the lofty ideas, the
grand schemes, and carnal boastings of the heart begin
to level down, when the Holy Spirit comes to work upon
the soul. Genuine humility is a very gracious fruit
of the Spirit. To be broken in heart is the best means
of preparing the soul for Jesus. "A broken and a contrite
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise." Brethren,
always be thankful when you see high thoughts of man
brought down; this settling the furrows is a very gracious
preparatory work of grace.</p>

<p>Yet again, it is added, "<i>Thou makest it soft with
showers</i>." Man's heart is naturally hardened against
the gospel; like the Eastern soil, it is hard as iron if
there be no gracious rain. How sweetly and effectively
does the Spirit of God soften the man through and
through! He is no longer towards the Word what he
used to be: he feels everything, whereas once he felt
nothing. The rock flows with water; the heart is dissolved
in tenderness, the eyes are melted into tears.</p>

<p>All this is God's work. I have said already that
God works through us, but still it is God's immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
work to send down the rain of his grace from on high.
Perhaps he is at work upon some of you, though as yet
there is no springing up of spiritual life in your souls.
Though your condition is still a sad one, we will hope
for you that ere long there shall be seen the living seed
of grace sending up its tender green shoot above the
soil, and may the Lord bless the springing thereof.</p>


<p class="p2">II. In the second place, let us deliver <span class="smcap">a brief description
of the springing thereof</span>.</p>

<p>After the operations of the Holy Spirit have been
quietly going on for a certain season as pleaseth the
great Master and Husbandman, then there are signs of
grace. Remember the apostle's words, "First the blade,
then the ear, then the full corn in the ear." Some of
our friends are greatly disturbed because they cannot
see the full corn in the ear in themselves. They suppose
that, if they were the subjects of a divine work,
they would be precisely like certain advanced Christians
with whom it is their privilege to commune, or of whom
they may have read in biographies. Beloved, this is a
very great mistake. When first grace enters the heart,
it is not a great tree covering with its shadow whole
acres, but it is the least of all seeds, like a grain of
mustard seed. When it first rises upon the soul, it is
not the sun shining at high noon, but it is the first dim
ray of dawn. Are you so simple as to expect the harvest
before you have passed through the springing-time?
I shall hope that by a very brief description of
the earliest stage of Christian experience you may be
led to say, "I have gone as far as that," and then I
hope you may be able to take the comfort of the text to
yourselves: "Thou blessest the springing thereof."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>What then is the springing up of piety in the heart?
We think it is first seen in <i>sincerely earnest desires after
salvation</i>. The man is not saved, in his own apprehension,
but he longs to be. That which was once a matter
of indifference is now a subject of intense concern.
Once he despised Christians, and thought them needlessly
earnest; he thought religion a mere trifle, and he
looked upon the things of time and sense as the only
substantial matters; but now how changed he is! He
envies the meanest Christian, and would change places
with the poorest believer if he might but be able to read
his title clear to mansions in the skies. Now worldly
things have lost dominion over him, and spiritual things
are uppermost. Once with the unthinking many, he
cried, "Who will show us any good?" but now he
cries, "Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance
upon me." Once it was the corn and the wine to which
he looked for comfort, but now he looks to God alone.
His rock of refuge must be God, for he finds no comfort
elsewhere. His holy desires, which he had years
ago, were like smoke from the chimney, soon blown
away; but now his longings are permanent, though not
always operative to the same degree. At times these
desires amount to a hungering and a thirsting after
righteousness, and yet he is not satisfied with these desires,
but wishes for a still more anxious longing after
heavenly things. These desires are among the first
springings of divine life in the soul.</p>

<p>"The springing thereof" shows itself next in
<i>prayer</i>. It <i>is</i> prayer now. Once it was the mocking of
God with holy sounds unattended by the heart; but
now, though the prayer is such that he would not like a
human ear to hear him, yet God approves it, for it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the talking of a spirit to a Spirit, and not the muttering
of lips to an unknown God. His prayers, perhaps, are
not very long: they do not amount to more than this,
"Oh!" "Ah!" "Would to God!" "Lord, have
mercy upon me, a sinner!" and such-like short ejaculations;
but, then, they <i>are</i> prayers. "Behold he prayeth,"
does not refer to a long prayer; it is quite as
sure a proof of spiritual life within, if it only refers to a
sigh or to a tear. These "groanings that cannot be
uttered," are among "the springings thereof."</p>

<p>There will also be manifest <i>a hearty love for the means
of grace</i>, and the house of God. The Bible, long unread,
which was thought to be of little more use than
an old almanac, is now treated with great consideration;
and though the reader finds little in it that comforts
him just now, and much that alarms him, yet he
feels that it is the book for him, and he turns to its
pages with hope. When he goes up to God's house, he
listens eagerly, hoping that there may be a message for
him. Before, he attended worship as a sort of pious
necessity incumbent upon all respectable people; but
now he goes up to God's house that he may find the
Saviour. Once there was no more religion in him than
in the door which turns upon its hinges; but now he
enters the house praying, "Lord, meet with my soul,"
and if he gets no blessing, he goes away sighing, "O
that I knew where I might find him, that I might come
even to his seat." This is one of the blessed signs of
"the springing thereof."</p>

<p>Yet more cheering is another, namely, that the soul
in this state has <i>faith in Jesus Christ</i>, at least in some
degree. It is not a faith which brings great joy and
peace, but still it is a faith which keeps the heart from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
despair, and prevents its sinking under a sense of sin.
I have known the time when I do not believe any man
living could see faith in me, and when I could scarcely
perceive any in myself, and yet I was bold to say, with
Peter, "Lord, thou knowest all things, <i>thou</i> knowest
that I love thee." What man cannot see, Christ can
see. Many people have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,
but they are so much engaged in looking at it that they
do not see it. If they would look to Christ and not to
their own faith, they would not only see Christ but see
their own faith too; but they measure their faith, and
it seems so little when they contrast it with the faith of
full-grown Christians, that they fear it is not faith at all.
Oh, little one, if thou hast faith enough to receive
Christ, remember the promise, "To as many as received
him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
God." Poor, simple, weak-hearted, and troubled one,
look to Jesus and answer, Can such a Saviour suffer in
vain? Can such an atonement be offered in vain?
Canst thou trust him, and yet be cast away? It cannot
be. It never was in the Saviour's heart to shake off one
that did cling to his arm. However feeble the faith, he
blesses "the springing thereof." The difficulty raises
partly from misapprehension and partly from want of
confidence in God. I say misapprehension: now if like
some Londoners you had never seen corn when it is
green, you would cry out, "What! Do you say that
yonder green stuff is wheat?" "Yes," the farmer says,
"that is wheat." You look at it again and you reply,
"Why, man alive, that is nothing but grass. You do
not mean to tell me that this grassy stuff will ever produce
a loaf of bread such as I see in the baker's window;
I cannot conceive it." No, you could not conceive it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
but when you get accustomed to it, it is not at all wonderful
to see the wheat go through certain stages; first
the blade, then the ear, and afterwards the full corn in
the ear. Some of you have never seen growing grace,
and do not know anything about it. When you are
newly converted you meet with Christians who are like
ripe golden ears, and you say, "I am not like them."
True, you are no more like them than that grassy stuff
in the furrows is like full-grown wheat; but you will
grow like them one of these days. You must expect to
go through the blade period before you get to the ear
period, and in the ear period you will have doubts
whether you will ever come to the full corn in the ear;
but you will arrive at perfection in due time. Thank
God that you are in Christ at all. Whether I have much
faith or little faith, whether I can do much for Christ
or little for Christ, is not the first question; I am saved,
not on account of what I am, but on account of what
Jesus Christ is; and if I am trusting to him, however
little in Israel I may be, I am as safe as the brightest of
the saints.</p>

<p>I have said, however, that mixed with misapprehension
there is a great deal of unbelief. I cannot put it
all down to an ignorance that may be forgiven: for
there is sinful unbelief too. O sinner, why do you not
trust Jesus Christ? Poor, quickened, awakened conscience,
God gives you his word that he who trusts in
Christ is not condemned, and yet you are afraid that
you are condemned! This is to give God the lie! Be
ashamed and confounded that you should ever have
been guilty of doubting the veracity of God. All your
other sins do not grieve Christ so much as the sin of
thinking that he is unwilling to forgive you, or the sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of suspecting that if you trust him he will cast you
away. Do not slander his gracious character. Do not
cast a slur upon the generosity of his tender heart. He
saith, "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast
out." Come in the faith of his promise, and he will
receive you just now.</p>

<p>I have thus given some description of "the springing
thereof."</p>


<p class="p2">III. Thirdly, according to the text, <span class="smcap">there is one
who sees this springing</span>. Thou, Lord&mdash;<i>thou</i> blessest
the springing thereof.</p>

<p>I wish that some of us had quicker eyes to see the
beginning of grace in the souls of men; for want of
this we let slip many opportunities of helping the weaklings.
If a woman had the charge of a number of children
that were not her own, I do not suppose she would
notice all the incipient stages of disease; but when a
mother nurses her own dear children, as soon as ever
upon the cheek or in the eye there is a token of approaching
sickness, she perceives it at once. I wish we
had just as quick an eye, because just as tender a heart,
towards precious souls. I do not doubt that many
young people are weeks and even months in distress,
who need not be, if you who know the Lord were a
little more watchful to help them in the time of their
sorrow. Shepherds are up all night at lambing time to
catch up the lambs as soon as they are born, and take
them in and nurse them; and we, who ought to be
shepherds for God, should be looking out for all the
lambs, especially at seasons when there are many born
into God's great fold, for tender nursing is wanted in
the first stages of the new life. God, however, when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
servants do not see "the springing thereof," sees
it all.</p>

<p>Now, you silent, retired spirits, who dare not speak
to father or mother, or brother or sister, this text ought
to be a sweet morsel to you. "<i>Thou</i> blessest the
springing thereof," which proves that God sees you and
your new-born grace. The Lord sees the first sign of
penitence. Though you only say to yourself, "I will
arise and go to my Father," your Father hears you.
Though it is nothing but a desire, your Father registers
it. "Thou puttest my tears into thy bottle. Are they
not in thy book?" He is watching your return; he
runs to meet you, and puts his arms about you, and
kisses you with the kisses of his accepting love. O soul,
be encouraged with that thought, that up in the chamber
or down by the hedge, or wherever it is that thou
hast sought secrecy, God is there. Dwell on the
thought, "Thou God seest me." That is a precious
text&mdash;"All my desire is before thee;" and here is
another sweet one, "The Lord taketh pleasure in them
that fear him, in them that hope in his mercy." He
can see you when you only hope in his mercy, and he
takes pleasure in you if you have only begun to fear
him. Here is a third choice word, "Thou wilt perfect
that which concerneth me." Have you a concern about
these things? Is it a matter of soul-concern with you
to be reconciled to God, and to have an interest in Jesus'
precious blood? It is only "the springing thereof,"
but he blesses it. It is written, "A bruised reed he will
not break, and the smoking flax he will not quench, till
he bring forth judgment unto victory." There shall be
victory for you, even before the judgment-seat of God,
though as yet you are only like the flax that smokes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
gives no light, or like the reed that is broken, and yields
no music. God sees the first springing of grace.</p>


<p class="p2">IV. A few words upon a fourth point: <span class="smcap">what a
misery it would be, if it were possible, to have this
springing without God's blessing</span>!</p>

<p>The text says, "Thou <i>blessest</i> the springing thereof."
We must, just a moment, by way of contrast,
think of how the springing would have been without
the blessing. Suppose we were to see a revival among
us without God's blessing. It is my conviction that
there are revivals which are not of God at all, but are
produced by excitement merely. If there be no blessing
from the Lord, it will be all a delusion, a bubble
blown up into the air for a moment, and then gone to
nothing. We shall only see the people stirred, to become
the more dull and dead afterwards; and this is a
great mischief to the church.</p>

<p>In the individual heart, if there should be a springing
up without God's blessing, there would be no good
in it. Suppose you have good desires, but no blessing
on these desires, they will only tantalize and worry
you; and then, after a time, they will be gone, and you
will be more impervious than you were before to religious
convictions; for, if religious desires are not of
God's sending, but are caused by excitement, they will
probably prevent your giving a serious hearing to the
Word of God in times to come. If convictions do not
soften they will certainly harden. To what extremities
have some been driven who have had springings of a
certain sort which have not led them to Christ! Some
have been crushed by despair. They tell us that
religion crowds the madhouse: it is not true; but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
is no doubt whatever that religiousness of a certain kind
has driven many a man out of his mind. The poor
souls have felt their wound but have not seen the balm.
They have not known Jesus. They have had a sense of
sin and nothing more. They have not fled for refuge
to the hope which God has set before them. Marvel
not if men do go mad when they refuse the Saviour.
It may come as a judicial visitation of God upon those
men who, when in great distress of mind, will not fly to
Christ. I believe it is with some just this&mdash;you must
either fly to Jesus, or else your burden will become
heavier and heavier until your spirit will utterly fail.
This is not the fault of religion, it is the fault of those
who will not accept the remedy which religion presents.
A springing up of desires without God's blessing would
be an awful thing, but we thank him that we are not
left in such a case.</p>


<p class="p2">V. And now I have to dwell upon <span class="smcap">the comforting
thought that God does bless "the springing thereof</span>."
I wish to deal with you who are tender and
troubled; I want to show that God <i>does</i> bless your
springing. He does it in many ways.</p>

<p>Frequently he does it by the cordials which he brings.
You have a few very sweet moments: you cannot say
that you are Christ's, but at times the bells of your
heart ring very sweetly at the mention of his name.
The means of grace are very precious to you. When
you gather to the Lord's worship you feel a holy calm,
and you go away from the service wishing that there
were seven Sundays in the week instead of one. By the
blessing of God the Word has just suited your case, as
if the Lord had sent his servants on purpose to you:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
you lay aside your crutches for awhile, and you begin
to run. Though these things have been sadly transient,
they are tokens for good.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you have had none of these
comforts, or few of them, and the means of grace have
not been consolations to you, I want you to look upon
that as a blessing. It may be the greatest blessing that
God can give us to take away all comforts on the road,
in order to quicken our running towards the end. When
a man is flying to the City of Refuge to be protected
from the man-slayer, it may be an act of great consideration
to stay him for a moment that he may quench
his thirst and run more swiftly afterwards; but perhaps,
in a case of imminent peril, it may be the kindest
thing neither to give him anything to eat or to drink,
nor invite him to stop for a moment, in order that he
may fly with undiminished speed to the place of safety.
The Lord may be blessing you in the uneasiness which
you feel. Inasmuch as you cannot say that you are in
Christ, it may be the greatest blessing which heaven can
give to take away every other blessing from you, in
order that you may be compelled to fly to the Lord.
You perhaps have a little of your self-righteousness left,
and while it is so you cannot get joy and comfort. The
royal robe which Jesus gives will never shine brilliantly
upon us till every rag of our own goodness is gone.
Perhaps you are not empty enough, and God will never
fill you with Christ till you are. Fear often drives men
to faith. Have you never heard of a person walking in
the fields into whose bosom a bird has flown because
pursued by the hawk? Poor, timid thing, it would not
have ventured there had not a greater fear compelled it.
All this may be so with you; your fears may be sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
drive you more swiftly and more closely to the Saviour,
and if so, I see in these present sorrows the signs that
God is blessing "the springing thereof."</p>

<p>In looking back upon my own "springing" I sometimes
think God blessed me then in a lovelier way than
now. Though I would not willingly return to that early
stage of my spiritual life, yet there were many joys
about it. An apple tree when loaded with apples is a
very comely sight: but give me, for beauty, the apple
tree in bloom. The whole world does not present a
more lovely sight than an apple blossom. Now, a full-grown
Christian laden with fruit is a comely sight, but
still there is a peculiar loveliness about the young Christian.
Let me tell you what that blessedness is; you have
probably now a greater horror of sin than professors
who have known the Lord for years; they might wish
that they felt your tenderness of conscience. You have
now a graver sense of duty, and a more solemn fear of
the neglect of it, than some who are further advanced.
You have also a greater zeal than many: you are now
doing your first works for God, and burning with your
first love; nothing is too hot or too heavy for you: I
pray that you may never decline, but always advance.</p>

<p>And now to close. I think there are three lessons
for us to learn. First, <i>let older saints be very gentle and kind
to young believers</i>. God blesses the springing thereof&mdash;mind
that you do the same. Do not throw cold water
upon young desires: do not snuff out young believers
with hard questions. While they are babes and need
the milk of the Word, do not be choking them with
your strong meat; they will eat strong meat by-and-by,
but not just yet. Remember, Jacob would not overdrive
the lambs; be equally prudent. Teach and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>struct
them, but let it be with gentleness and tenderness,
not as their superiors, but as nursing fathers for
Christ's sake. God, you see, blesses the springing
thereof&mdash;may he bless it through you!</p>

<p>The next thing I have to say is, <i>fulfil the duty of
gratitude</i>. Beloved, if God blesses the springing thereof
we ought to be grateful for a little grace. If you have
only seen the first shoot peeping up through the mould
be thankful, and you shall see the green blade waving
in the breeze; be thankful for the ankle-deep verdure
and you shall soon see the commencement of the ear;
be thankful for the first green ears and you shall see
the flowering of the wheat, and by-and-by its ripening,
and the joyous harvest.</p>

<p>The last lesson is one of <i>encouragement</i>. If God
blesses "the springing thereof," dear beginners, what
will he not do for you in after days? If he gives you
such a meal when you break your fast, what dainties
will be on your table when he says to you, "Come and
dine"; and what a banquet will he furnish at the supper
of the Lamb! O troubled one! let the storms
which howl and the snows which fall, and the wintry
blasts that nip your springing, all be forgotten in this
one consoling thought, that God blesses your springing,
and whom God blesses none can curse. Over your
head, dear, desiring, pleading, languishing soul, the
Lord of heaven and earth pronounces the blessing of
the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Take
that blessing and rejoice in it evermore. Amen.</p>


<h2><a name="FARM_LABORERS" id="FARM_LABORERS">FARM LABORERS.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then
neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that
giveth the increase. Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and
every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we are
laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry."&mdash;<span class="smcap">1 Corinthians</span> 3:6-9.</p>


<p class="p2">I <span class="smcap">shall</span> begin at the end of my text, because I find
it to be the easiest way of mapping out my discourse.
We shall first remark that <i>the church is God's farm</i>: "Ye
are God's husbandry." In the margin of the revised
version we read, "Ye are God's tilled ground," and
that is the very expression for me. "Ye are God's
tilled ground," or farm. After we have spoken of the
farm we will next say a little upon the fact that <i>the
Lord employs laborers</i> on his estate: and when we have
looked at the laborers&mdash;such poor fellows as they are&mdash;we
will remember that <i>God himself is the great worker</i>:
"We are laborers together with God."</p>


<p class="p2">I. We begin by considering that <span class="smcap">the church is
God's farm</span>. The Lord has made the church his own
by his sovereign <i>choice</i>. He has also secured it unto
himself by <i>purchase</i>, having paid for it a price immense.
"The Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of
his inheritance." Every acre of God's farm cost the
Saviour a bloody sweat, yea, the blood of his heart.
He loved us, and gave himself for us: that is the price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
he paid. Henceforth the church is God's freehold, and
he holds the title deeds of it. It is our joy to feel that
we are not our own, we are bought with a price. The
church is God's farm by choice and purchase.</p>

<p>And now he has made it his by <i>enclosure</i>. It lay exposed
aforetime as part of an open common, bare and
barren, covered with thorns and thistles, and the haunt
of every wild beast; for we were "by nature the children
of wrath, even as others." Divine foreknowledge
surveyed the waste, and electing love marked out its
portion with a full line of grace, and thus set us apart
to be the Lord's own estate forever. In due time effectual
grace came forth with power, and separated us from
the rest of mankind, as fields are hedged and ditched to
part them from the open heath. Hath not the Lord declared
that he hath chosen his vineyard and fenced it?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"We are a garden wall'd around,</div>
<div class="line ip5 small">Chosen and made peculiar ground;</div>
<div class="line ip5 small">A little spot, enclosed by grace</div>
<div class="line ip5 small">Out of the world's wide wilderness."</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>The Lord has also made this farm evidently his own
by <i>cultivation</i>. What more could he have done for his farm?
He has totally changed the nature of the soil: from
being barren he hath made it a fruitful land. He hath
ploughed it, and digged it, and fattened it, and watered
it, and planted it with all manner of flowers and fruits.
It hath already brought forth to him many a pleasant
cluster, and there are brighter times to come, when
angels shall shout the harvest home, and Christ "shall
see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied."</p>

<p>This farm is preserved by the Lord's continual
<i>protection</i>. Not only did he enclose it, and cultivate it by
his miraculous power, to make it his own farm, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
continually maintains possession of it. "I the Lord do
keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
hurt it, I will keep it night and day." If it were not
for God's continual power her hedges would soon be
thrown down, and wild beasts would devour her fields.
Wicked hands are always trying to break down her walls
and lay her waste again, so that there should be no true
church in the world; but the Lord is jealous for his land,
and will not allow it to be destroyed. A church would
not long remain a church if God did not preserve it unto
himself. What if God should say, "I will take away
the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break
down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down"?
What a wilderness it would become. What saith he?
"Go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where
I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for
the wickedness of my people Israel." Go ye to Jerusalem,
where of old was the city of his glory and the shrine
of his indwelling, and what is left there to-day? Go ye
to Rome, where once Paul preached the gospel with
power: what is it now but the centre of idolatry? The
Lord may remove the candlestick, and leave a place
that was bright as day to become black as darkness
itself. Hence God's farm remains a farm because he is
ever in it to prevent its returning to its former wildness.
Omnipotent power is as needful to keep the fields
of the church under cultivation as to reclaim them at
the first.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the church is God's own farm, <i>he expects
to receive a harvest from it</i>. The world is waste, and
he looks for nothing from it; but we are tilled land, and
therefore a harvest is due from us. Barrenness suits the
moorland, but to a farm it would be a great discredit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Love looks for returns of love; grace given demands
gracious fruit. Watered with the drops of the Saviour's
bloody sweat, shall we not bring forth a hundredfold
to his praise? Kept by the eternal Spirit of God, shall
there not be produced in us fruits to his glory? The
Lord's husbandry upon us has shown a great expenditure
of cost, and labor, and thought; ought there
not to be a proportionate return? Ought not the
Lord to have a harvest of obedience, a harvest of
holiness, a harvest of usefulness, a harvest of praise?
Shall it not be so? I think some churches forget
that an increase is expected from every field of the
Lord's farm, for they never have a harvest or even look
for one. Farmers do not plough their lands or sow their
fields for amusement; they mean business, and plough
and sow because they desire a harvest. If this fact
could but enter into the heads of some professors, surely
they would look at things in a different light; but of
late it has seemed as if we thought that God's church
was not expected to produce anything, but existed for
her own comfort and personal benefit. Brethren, it
must not be so; the great Husbandman must have some
reward for his husbandry. Every field must yield its
increase, and the whole estate must bring forth to his
praise. We join with the bride in the Song in saying,
"My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O
Solomon, must have thousand, and those that keep the
fruit thereof two hundred."</p>

<p>But I come back to the place from which I started.
This farm is, by choice, by purchase, by enclosure, by
cultivation, by preservation, entirely the Lord's. See,
then, the injustice of allowing any of the laborers to
call even a part of the estate his own. When a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
man has a large farm of his own, what would he think if
Hodge the ploughman should say, "Look here, I plough
this farm, and therefore it is mine: I shall call this field
Hodge's Acres"? "No," says Hobbs, "I reaped that
land last harvest, and therefore it is mine, and I shall
call it Hobbs's Field." What if all the other laborers
became Hodgeites and Hobbsites, and so parcelled out
the farm among them? I think the landlord would
soon eject the lot of them. The farm belongs to its
owner, and let it be called by his name; but it is absurd
to call it by the names of the men who labor upon
it. Shall insignificant nobodies rob God of his glory?
Remember how Paul put it: "Who then is Paul, and
who is Apollos?" "Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified
for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"
The entire church belongs to him who has chosen it in
his sovereignty, bought it with his blood, fenced it by
his grace, cultivated it by his wisdom, and preserved it
by his power. There is but one church on the face of the
earth, and those who love the Lord should keep this truth
in mind. Paul is a laborer, Apollos is a laborer, Cephas
is a laborer; but the farm is not Paul's, not so much as
a rood of it, nor does a single parcel of land belong to
Apollos, or the smallest allotment to Cephas; for "Ye
are Christ's." The fact is that in this case the laborers
belong to the land, and not the land to the laborers:
"For all things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos,
or Cephas." "We preach not ourselves, but Christ
Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus'
sake."</p>


<p class="p2">II. We have now to notice, as our second head, that
<span class="smcap">the great husbandman employs laborers</span>. <i>By human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
agency God ordinarily works out his designs.</i> He can, if he
pleases, by his Holy Spirit get directly at the hearts of
men, but that is his business, and not ours; we have to
do with such words as these: "It pleased God by the
foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
The Master's commission is not, "Sit still and see the
Spirit of God convert the nations;" but, "Go ye into
all the world and preach the gospel to every creature."
Observe God's method in supplying the race
with food. In answer to the prayer, "Give us this
day our daily bread," he might have bidden the clouds
drop manna, morning by morning, at each man's
door; but he sees that it is for our good to work,
and so he uses the hands of the ploughman and the
sower for our supply. God might cultivate his chosen
farm, the church, by miracle, or by angels; but in great
condescension he blesses her through her own sons and
daughters. He employs us for our own good; for
we who are laborers in his fields receive much more
good for ourselves than we bestow. Labor develops
our spiritual muscle and keeps us in health. "Unto
me," says Paul, "who am less than the least of all
saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among
the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ."</p>

<p>Our great Master means that every laborer on his
farm should receive some benefit from it, for he never
muzzles the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn.
The laborer's daily bread comes out of the soil. Though
he works not for himself, but for his Master, yet still he
has his portion of food. In the Lord's granary there is
seed for the sower, but there is also bread for the eater.
However disinterestedly we may serve God in the husbandry
of his church, we are ourselves partakers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
fruit. It is a great condescension on God's part that
he uses us at all, for we are poor tools at the best, and
more hindrance than help.</p>

<p>The laborers employed by God are all <i>occupied upon
needful work</i>. Notice: "I have planted, Apollos
watered." Who beat the big drum, or blew his own
trumpet? Nobody. On God's farm none are kept for
ornamental purposes. I have read some sermons which
could only have been meant for show, for there was not
a grain of gospel in them. They were ploughs with
the share left out, drills with no wheat in the box, clod-crushers
made of butter. I do not believe that our God
will ever pay wages to men who only walk about his
grounds to show themselves. Orators who display
their eloquence in the pulpit are more like gypsies
who stray on the farm to pick up chickens, than honest
laborers who work to bring forth a crop for their
master. Many of the members of our churches live
as if their only business on the farm was to pluck
blackberries or gather wild flowers. They are great at
finding fault with other people's ploughing and mowing;
but not a hand's turn will they do themselves. Come
on, my good fellows. Why stand ye all the day idle?
The harvest is plenteous, and the laborers are few.
You who think yourselves more cultivated than ordinary
people, if you are indeed Christians, must not strut
about and despise those who are hard at work. If you
do, I shall say, "That person has mistaken his master;
he may probably be in the employ of some gentleman
farmer, who cares more for show than profit; but our
great Lord is practical, and on his estate his laborers
attend to needful labor." When you and I preach or
teach it will be well if we say to ourselves, "What will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
be the use of what I am going to do? I am about to
teach a difficult subject; will it do any good? I have
chosen an abstruse point of theology; will it serve any
purpose?" Brethren, a laborer may work very hard at
a whim of his own, and yet it may be all waste labor.
Some discourses do little more than show the difference
between tweedle-<i>dum</i> and tweedle-<i>dee</i>, and what is the
use of that? Suppose we sow the fields with sawdust,
or sprinkle them with rose-water, what of that? Will
God bless our moral essays, and fine compositions, and
pretty passages? Brethren, we must aim at usefulness:
we must as laborers together with God be occupied with
something that is worth doing. "I," says one, "have
planted": it is well, for planting must be done. "I,"
answers another, "have watered": that also is good
and necessary. See to it that ye can each bring in a solid
report; but let no man be content with the mere child's-play
of oratory, or the getting up of entertainments
and such like.</p>

<p>On the Lord's farm <i>there is a division of labor</i>. Even
Paul did not say, "I have planted and watered." No,
Paul planted. And certainly Apollos could not say,
"I have planted as well as watered." No, it was
enough for him to attend to the watering. No man has
all gifts. How foolish, then, are they who say, "I enjoy
So-and-so's ministry because he edifies the saints in
doctrine; but when he was away the other Sunday I
could not profit by the preacher because he was all for
the conversion of sinners." Yes, he was planting; you
have been planted a good while, and do not need
planting again; but you ought to be thankful that others
are made partakers of the benefit. One soweth and another
reapeth, and therefore instead of grumbling at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the honest ploughman because he did not bring a sickle
with him, you ought to have prayed for him that he
might have strength to plough deep and break up hard
hearts.</p>

<p>Observe that, on God's farm, <i>there is unity of purpose</i>
among the laborers. Read the text. "Now he that
planteth and he that watereth are one." One Master has
employed them, and though he may send them out at
different times, and to different parts of the farm, yet
they are all one in being used for one end, to work for
one harvest. In England we do not understand what is
meant by watering, because the farmer could not water
all his farm; but in the East a farmer waters almost
every inch of his ground. He would have no crop if
he did not use all means for irrigating the fields. If
you have ever been in Italy, Egypt, or Palestine, you
will have seen a complete system of wells, pumps,
wheels, buckets, channels, little streamlets, pipes, and
so on, by which the water is carried all over the garden
to every plant, otherwise in the extreme heat of the sun
it would be dried up. Planting needs wisdom, watering
needs quite as much, and the piecing of these two works
together needs that the laborers should be of one mind.
It is a bad thing when laborers are at cross purposes, and
work against each other, and this evil is worse in the
church than anywhere else. How can I plant with
success if my helper will not water what I have planted;
or what is the use of my watering if nothing is planted?
Husbandry is spoiled when foolish people undertake it,
and quarrel over it; for from sowing to reaping the work
is one, and all must be done to one end. Let us pull
together all our days, for strife brings barrenness.</p>

<p>We are called upon to notice in our text that <i>all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
laborers put together are nothing at all</i>. "Neither is he that
planteth anything, neither he that watereth." The
workmen are nothing at all without their master. All
the laborers on a farm could not manage it if they had
no one at their head, and all the preachers and Christian
workers in the world can do nothing unless God be
with them. Remember that every laborer on God's farm
has derived all his qualifications from God. No man
knows how to plant or water souls except the Lord
teaches him from day to day. All these holy gifts are
grants of free grace. All the laborers work under
God's direction and arrangement, or they work in
vain. They would not know when or how to do their
work if their Master did not guide them by his Spirit,
without whose help they cannot even think a good
thought. All God's laborers must go to him for their
seed, or else they will scatter tares. All good seed
comes out of God's granary. If we preach, it must be
the true word of God, or nothing can come of it. More
than that, all the strength that is in the laborer's arm
to sow the heavenly seed must be given by the Master.
We cannot preach except God be with us. A sermon
is vain talk and dreary word-spinning unless the Holy
Spirit enlivens it. He must give us both the preparation
of the heart and the answer of the tongue, or we
shall be as men who sow the wind. When the good seed
is sown the whole success of it rests with God. If he
withhold the dew and the rain the seed will never rise
from the ground; and unless he shall shine upon it the
green ear will never ripen. The human heart will remain
barren, even though Paul himself should preach,
unless God the Holy Ghost shall work with Paul and
bless the word to those that hear it. Therefore, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the increase is of God alone, put the laborers into their
place. Do not make too much of us; for when we have
done all we are unprofitable servants.</p>

<p>Yet, though inspiration calls the laborers nothing, it
says that <i>they shall be rewarded</i>. God works our good works
in us, and then rewards us for them. Here we have mention
of a personal service, and a personal reward: "Every
man shall receive his own reward according to his own
labor." The reward is proportionate, not to the success,
but to the labor. Many discouraged workers may
be comforted by that expression. You are not to be
paid by results, but by endeavors. You may have a
stiff bit of clay to plough, or a dreary plot of land to
sow, where stones, and birds, and thorns, and travellers,
and a burning sun may all be leagued against the
seed; but you are not accountable for these things;
your reward shall be according to your work. Some
put a great deal of labor into a little field, and make
much out of it. Others use a great deal of labor throughout
a long life, and yet they see but small result, for it
is written, "One soweth, and another reapeth": but the
reaping man will not get all the reward, the sowing man
shall receive his portion of the joy. The laborers are
nobodies, but they shall enter into the joy of their Lord.</p>

<p><i>Unitedly</i>, according to the text, <i>the workers have been
successful</i>, and that is a great part of their reward. "I
have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
Frequently brethren say in their prayers, "A
Paul may plant, an Apollos may water, but it is all in
vain unless God gives the increase." This is quite
true; but another truth is too much overlooked,
namely, that when Paul plants and Apollos waters,
God does give the increase. We do not labor in vain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
There would be no increase without God; but then we
are not without God: when such men as Paul and
Apollos plant and water, there is sure to be an increase;
they are the right kind of laborers, they work in a right
spirit, and God is certain to bless them. This is a great
part of the laborer's wages.</p>


<p class="p2">III. So much upon the laborers. Now for the main
point again. <span class="smcap">God himself is the great Worker.</span> He
may use what laborers he pleases, but the increase
comes alone from him. Brethren, you know it is so in
natural things: the most skilful farmer cannot make
the wheat germinate, and grow, and ripen. He cannot
even preserve a single field till harvest time, for the
farmer's enemies are many and mighty. In husbandry
there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip; and
when the farmer thinks, good easy man, that he shall
reap his crop, there are blights and mildews lingering
about to rob him of his gains. God must give the
increase. If any man is dependent on God it is the
husbandman, and through him we are all of us dependent
upon God from year to year for the food by which
we live. Even the king must live by the produce of
the field. God gives the increase in the barn and the
hay-rick; and in the spiritual farm it is even more so,
for what can man do in this business? If any of you
think that it is an easy thing to win a soul I should like
you to attempt it. Suppose that without divine aid
you should try to save a soul&mdash;you might as well attempt
to make a world. Why, you cannot create a
fly, how can you create a new heart and a right
spirit? Regeneration is a great mystery, it is out of
your reach. "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence
it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is
born of the Spirit." What can you and I do in this matter?
it is far beyond our line. We can tell out the truth
of God; but to apply that truth to the heart and conscience
is quite another thing. I have preached Jesus
Christ with my whole heart, and yet I know that I have
never produced a saving effect upon a single unregenerate
man unless the Spirit of God has opened the heart
and placed the living seed of truth within it. Experience
teaches us this. Equally is it the Lord's work to
keep the seed alive when it springs up. We think we
have converts, and we are not long before we are disappointed
in them. Many are like blossoms on our apple
trees; they are fair to look upon, but they do not come
to anything; and others are like the many little apples
which fall off long before they have come to any size.
He who presides over a great church, and feels an agony
for the souls of men, will soon be convinced that if God
does not work there will be no work done: we shall see
no conversion, no sanctification, no final perseverance,
no glory brought to God, no satisfaction for the passion
of the Saviour, unless the Lord be with us. Well
said our Lord, "Without me ye can do nothing."</p>


<p class="p2">Briefly I would draw certain practical lessons out
of this important truth: the first is, if the whole farm
of the church belongs exclusively to the great Master
Worker, and the laborers are worth nothing without
him, <i>let this promote unity among all whom he employs</i>. If
we are all under one Master, do not let us quarrel. It
is a miserable business when we cannot bear to see good
being done by those of a different denomination who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
work in ways of their own. If a new laborer comes
on the farm, and he uses a hoe of a new shape, shall I
become his enemy? If he does his work better than I
do mine, shall I be jealous? Do you not remember
reading in the Scriptures that, upon one occasion, the
disciples could not cast out a devil? This ought to
have made them humble; but to our surprise we read a
few verses further on that they saw one casting out
devils in Christ's name, and they forbade him because he
followed not with their company. <i>They</i> could not cast
out the devil themselves, and they forbade those who
could. A certain band of people are going about winning
souls, but because they are not doing it in our
fashion, we do not like it. It is true they have odd
ways; but they do really save souls, and that is the
main point. Instead of cavilling, let us encourage all
on Christ's side. Wisdom is justified of her children,
though some of them are far from handsome. The
laborers ought to be satisfied with the new ploughman if
their Master smiles upon him. Brother, if the great
Lord has employed you, it is no business of mine to
question his choice. Can I lend you a hand? Can
I show you how to work better? Or can you show me
how I can improve? This is the proper behavior of
one workman to another.</p>

<p>This truth, however, ought to <i>keep all the laborers
very dependent</i>. Are you going to preach, young man?
"Yes, I am going to do a great deal of good." Are
you? Have you forgotten that you are nothing?
"Neither is he that planteth anything." A divine is
coming brimful of the gospel to comfort the saints. If
he is not coming in strict dependence upon God, he, too,
is nothing. "Neither is he that watereth anything."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Power belongeth unto God. Man is vanity and his
words are wind; to God alone belongeth power and
wisdom. If we keep our places in all lowliness our
Lord will use us; but if we exalt ourselves he will leave
us to our nothingness.</p>

<p>Next notice that <i>this fact ennobles everybody who labors
in God's husbandry</i>. My soul is lifted up with joy when I
mark these words, "For we are laborers together with
God": mere laborers on his farm, and yet laborers
<i>with him</i>. Does the Lord work with us? We know he
does by the signs following. "My Father worketh
hitherto, and I work," is language for all the sons of
God as well as for the great Firstborn. God is with
you, my brethren, when you are serving him with all your
heart. Speaking to your class concerning Jesus, it is
God that speaks by you; picking up that stranger on
the way, and telling him of salvation by faith, Christ is
speaking through you even as he spoke with the woman
at the well; addressing the rough crowd in the open
air, young man, if you are preaching pardon through
the atoning blood, it is the God of Peter who is testifying
of his Son, even as he did on the day of Pentecost.</p>

<p>But, lastly, <i>how this should drive us to our knees</i>.
Since we are nothing without God, let us cry mightily
unto him for help in this our holy service. Let both
sower and reaper pray together, or they will never rejoice
together. If the blessing be withheld, it is because
we do not cry for it and expect it. Brother laborers,
come to the mercy-seat, and we shall yet see the
reapers return from the fields bringing their sheaves
with them, though, perhaps, they went forth weeping to
the sowing. To our Father, who is the husbandman,
be all glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

WHAT THEY CANNOT DO.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into
the ground; and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should
spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit
of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. But
when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because
the harvest is come."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mark</span> 4:26-29.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a lesson for "laborers together with God."
It is a parable for all who are concerned in the kingdom
of God. It will be of little value to those who are in
the kingdom of darkness, for they are not bidden to
sow the good seed: "Unto the wicked God saith, What
hast thou to do to declare my statutes?" But all who
are commissioned to scatter seed for the Royal Husbandman,
will be glad to know how the harvest is preparing
for him whom they serve. Listen, then, ye that
sow beside all waters; ye that with holy diligence seek
to fill the garners of heaven&mdash;listen, and may the Spirit
of God speak into your ears as you are able to bear it.</p>


<p class="p2">I. We shall, first, learn from our text <span class="smcap">what we can
do and what we cannot do</span>. Let this stand as our first
head.</p>

<p>"So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
seed into the ground:" this the gracious worker can
do. "And the seed should spring and grow up, he
knoweth not how:" this is what he cannot do: seed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
once sown is beyond human jurisdiction, and man can
neither make it spring nor grow. Yet ere long the
worker comes in again:&mdash;"When the fruit is brought
forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle." We can
reap in due season, and it is both our duty and our privilege
to do so. You see, then, that there is a place for
the worker at the beginning, and though there is no
room for him in the middle passage, yet another opportunity
is given him further on when that which he sowed
has actually yielded fruit.</p>

<p>Notice, then, that <i>we can sow</i>. Any man who has
received the knowledge of the grace of God in his heart
can teach others. I include under the term "man" all
who know the Lord, be they male or female. We cannot
all teach alike, for all have not the same gifts; to
one is given one talent, and to another ten; neither
have we all the same opportunities, for one lives in obscurity
and another has far-reaching influence; yet
there is not within the family of God an infant hand
which may not drop its own tiny seed into the ground.
There is not a man among us who needs to stand idle in
the market-place, for work suitable to his strength is
waiting for him. There is not a saved woman who is
left without a holy task; let her do it and win the approving
word, "She hath done what she could."</p>

<p>We need never quarrel with God because we cannot
do everything, if he only permits us to do this one
thing; for sowing the good seed is a work which will
need all our wit, our strength, our love, our care. Holy
seed sowing should be adopted as our highest pursuit,
and it will be no inferior object for the noblest life.
You will need heavenly teaching that you may carefully
select the wheat, and keep it free from the darnel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
error. You will require instruction to winnow out of
it your own thoughts and opinions; for these may not
be according to the mind of God. Men are not saved
by our word, but by God's word. We need grace to
learn the gospel aright, and to teach the whole of it.
To different men we must, with discretion, bring forward
that part of the word of God which will best bear
upon their consciences; for much may depend upon
the word being <i>in season</i>.</p>

<p>Having selected the seed, we shall have plenty of
work if we go forth and sow it broadcast everywhere,
for every day brings its opportunity, and every company
furnishes its occasion. "In the morning sow thy
seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand."
"Sow beside all waters."</p>

<p>Still, wise sowers discover favorable opportunities
for sowing, and gladly seize upon them. There are
times when it would clearly be a waste to sow; for the
soil could not receive it, it is not in a fit condition.
After a shower, or before a shower, or at some such
time as he that hath studied husbandry prefers, then
must we be up and doing. While we are to work for
God always, yet there are seasons when it were casting
pearls before swine to talk of holy things, and there are
other times when to be silent would be a great sin.
Sluggards in the time for ploughing and sowing are
sluggards indeed, for they not only waste the day, but
throw away the year. If you watch for souls, and use
hours of happy vantage, and moments of sacred softening,
you will not complain of the scanty space allowed
for agency. Even should you never be called to water,
or to reap, your office is wide enough if you fulfil the
work of the sower.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>For little though it seem to teach the simple truth
of the gospel, yet it is essential. How shall men hear
without a teacher? Servants of God, the seed of the
word is not like thistle-down, which is borne by every
wind; but the wheat of the kingdom needs a human
hand to sow it, and without such agency it will not
enter into men's hearts, neither can it bring forth fruit
to the glory of God. The preaching of the gospel is
the necessity of every age; God grant that our country
may never be deprived of it. Even if the Lord should
send us a famine of bread and of water, may he never
send us a famine of the word of God. Faith cometh by
hearing, and how can there be hearing if there is no
teaching? Scatter ye, scatter ye, then, the seed of the
kingdom, for this is essential to the harvest.</p>

<p>This seed should be sown often, for many are the
foes of the wheat, and if you repeat not your sowing
you may never see a harvest. The seed must be sown
everywhere, too, for there are no choice corners of the
world that you can afford to let alone, in the hope that
they will be self-productive. You may not leave the
rich and intelligent under the notion that surely the
gospel will be found among them, for it is not so: the
pride of life leads them away from God. You may not
leave the poor and illiterate, and say, "Surely they will
of themselves feel their need of Christ." Not so: they
will sink from degradation to degradation unless you
uplift them with the gospel. No tribe of man, no peculiar
constitution of the human mind, may be neglected
by us; but everywhere we must preach the word, in
season and out of season. I have heard that Captain
Cook, the celebrated circumnavigator, in whatever part
of the earth he landed, took with him a little packet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
English seeds, and scattered them in suitable places.
He would leave the boat and wander up from the shore.
He said nothing, but quietly scattered the seeds wherever
he went, so that he belted the world with the flowers
and herbs of his native land. Imitate him wherever
you go; sow spiritual seed in every place that your foot
shall tread upon.</p>

<p>Let us now think of what you cannot do. <i>You cannot,
after the seed has left your hand, cause it to put forth
life.</i> I am sure you cannot make it grow, for you do
not know how it grows. The text saith, "And the seed
should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how."
That which is beyond the range of our knowledge is
certainly beyond the reach of our power. Can you
make a seed germinate? You may place it under circumstances
of damp and heat which will cause it to
swell and break forth with a shoot, but the germination
itself is beyond you. How is it done? We know not.
After the germ has been put forth, can you make it
further grow, and develop its life into leaf and stem?
No; that, too, is out of your power. And when the
green, grassy blade has been succeeded by the ear, can
you ripen it? It will be ripened; but can <i>you</i> do it?
You know you cannot; you can have no finger in the
actual process, though you may promote the conditions
under which it is carried on. Life is a mystery; growth
is a mystery; ripening is a mystery: and these three
mysteries are as fountains sealed against all intrusion.
How comes it that there is within the ripe seed the
preparations for another sowing and another growth?
What is this vital principle, this secret reproducing
energy? Knowest thou anything about this? The
philosopher may talk about chemical combinations, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
he may proceed to quote analogies from this and that;
but still the growth of the seed remains a secret; it
springs up, he knoweth not how. Certainly this is true
of the rise and progress of the life of God in the heart.
It enters the soul, and roots itself we know not how.
Naturally men hate the word, but it enters and it
changes their hearts, so that they come to love it; yet
we know not how. Their whole nature is renewed, so
that instead of producing sin it yields repentance, faith,
and love; but we know not how. How the Spirit of
God deals with the mind of man, how he creates the
new heart and the right spirit, how we are begotten
again unto a lively hope, we cannot tell. The Holy
Ghost enters into us; we hear not his voice, we see not
his light, we feel not his touch; yet he worketh an
effectual work upon us, which we are not long in perceiving.
We know that the work of the Spirit is a new
creation, a resurrection, a quickening from the dead;
but all these words are only covers to our utter ignorance
of the mode of his working, with which it is not in
our power to meddle. We do not know how he performs
his miracles of love, and, not knowing how he
works, we may be quite sure that we cannot take the
work out of his hands. We cannot create, we cannot
quicken, we cannot transform, we cannot regenerate,
we cannot save.</p>

<p>This work of God having proceeded in the growth
of the seed, what next? <i>We can reap the ripe ears.</i> After
a season God the Holy Spirit uses his servants again.
As soon as the living seed has produced first of all the
blade of thought, and afterwards the green ear of conviction,
and then faith, which is as full corn in the ear,
then the Christian worker comes in for further service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
for <i>he can reap</i>. "When the fruit is brought forth, immediately
he putteth in the sickle." This is not the
reaping of the last great day, for that does not come
within the scope of the parable, which evidently relates
to a human sower and reaper. The kind of reaping
which the Saviour here intends is that which he referred
to when he said to his disciples, "Lift up your eyes,
and look on the fields; for they are white already to
harvest." After he had been sowing the seed in the
hearts of the Samaritans, and it had sprung up, so that
they began to evince faith in him, the Lord Jesus cried,
"The fields are white to harvest." The apostle saith,
"One soweth, and another reapeth." Our Lord said
to the disciples, "I sent you to reap that whereon ye
bestowed no labor." Is there not a promise, "In due
season we shall reap, if we faint not"?</p>

<p>Christian workers begin their harvest work by
watching for signs of faith in Christ. They are eager
to see the blade, and delighted to mark the ripening
ear. They often hope that men are believers, but they
long to be sure of it; and when they judge that at last
the fruit of faith is put forth, they begin to encourage,
to congratulate, and to comfort. They know that the
young believer needs to be housed in the barn of Christian
fellowship, that he may be saved from a thousand
perils. No wise farmer leaves the fruit of the field long
exposed to the hail which might beat it out, or to the
mildew which might destroy it, or to the birds which
might devour it. Evidently no believing man should
be left outside of the garner of holy fellowship; he
should be carried into the midst of the church with all
the joy which attends the home-bringing of sheaves.
The worker for Christ watches carefully, and when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
discerns that his time is come, he begins at once to fetch
in the converts, that they may be cared for by the
brotherhood, separated from the world, screened from
temptation, and laid up for the Lord. He is diligent to
do it at once, because the text saith, "immediately he
putteth in the sickle." He does not wait for months in
cold suspicion; he is not afraid that he shall encourage
too soon when faith is really present. He comes with
the word of promise and the smile of brotherly love at
once, and he says to the new believer, "Have you confessed
your faith? Is not the time come for an open
confession? Hath not Jesus bidden the believer to be
baptized? If you love him, keep his commandments."
He does not rest till he has introduced the convert to
the communion of the faithful. For our work, beloved,
is but half done when men are made disciples and
baptized. We have then to encourage, to instruct, to
strengthen, to console, and succor in all times of difficulty
and danger. What saith the Saviour? "Go ye
therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
them into the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all
things whatsoever I have commanded you."</p>

<p>Observe, then, the sphere and limit of agency. We
can introduce the truth to men, but that truth the Lord
himself must bless; the living and growing of the word
within the soul is of God alone. When the mystic work
of growth is done, we are able to garner the saved ones
in the church. For Christ to be formed in men the hope
of glory is not of our working, that remains with God;
but, when Jesus Christ is formed in them, to discern the
image of the Saviour and to say, "Come in, thou blessed
of the Lord, wherefore standest thou without?" this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
our duty and delight. To create the divine life is
God's, to cherish it is ours. To cause the hidden life to
grow is the work of the Lord; to see the uprising and
development of that life and to harvest it is the work
of the faithful, even as it is written, "When the fruit
is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle,
because the harvest is come."</p>

<p>This, then, is our first lesson; we see what we can
do and what we cannot do.</p>


<p class="p2">II. Our second head is like unto the first, and
consists of <span class="smcap">what we can know and what we cannot
know</span>.</p>

<p>First, <i>what we can know</i>. We can know when we
have sown the good seed of the word that it will grow;
for God has promised that it shall do so. Not every
grain in every place; for some will go to the bird, and
some to the worm, and some to be scorched by the sun;
but, as a general rule, God's word shall not return unto
him void, it shall prosper in the thing whereto he hath
sent it. This we can know. And we can know that
the seed when once it takes root will continue to grow;
that it is not a dream or a picture that will disappear,
but a thing of force and energy, which will advance
from a grassy blade to corn in the ear, and under God's
blessing will develop to actual salvation, and be as the
"full corn in the ear." God helping and blessing it,
our work of teaching will not only lead men to thought
and conviction, but to conversion and eternal life.</p>

<p>We also can know, because we are told so, that the
reason for this is mainly because there is life in the
word. In the word of God itself there is life, for it is
written&mdash;"The word of God is quick and powerful,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
that is, "living and powerful." It is "the incorruptible
seed which liveth and abideth for ever." It is the
nature of living seeds to grow; and the reason why
the word of God grows in men's hearts is because it
is the living word of the living God, and where the word
of a king is there is power. We know this, because the
Scriptures teach us so. Is it not written, "Of his own
will begat he us by the word of truth"?</p>

<p>Moreover, the earth, which is here the type of the
man, "bringeth forth fruit of herself." We must mind
what we are at in expounding this, for human hearts do
not produce faith of themselves; they are as hard rock
on which the seed perishes. But it means this&mdash;that as
the earth under the blessing of the dew and the rain is,
by God's secret working upon it, made to take up and
embrace the seed, so the heart of man is made ready to
receive and enfold the gospel of Jesus Christ within
itself. Man's awakened heart wants exactly what the
word of God supplies. Moved by a divine influence the
soul embraces the truth, and is embraced by it, and so
the truth lives in the heart, and is quickened by it.
Man's love accepts the love of God; man's faith
wrought in him by the Spirit of God believes the truth
of God; man's hope wrought in him by the Holy Ghost
lays hold upon the things revealed, and so the heavenly
seed grows in the soil of the soul. The life comes not
from you who preach the word, but it is placed within
the word which you preach by the Holy Spirit. The life
is not in your hand, but in the heart which is led to take
hold upon the truth by the Spirit of God. Salvation
comes not from the personal authority of the preacher,
but through the personal conviction, personal faith,
and personal love of the hearer. So much as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
we may know, and is it not enough for all practical
purposes?</p>

<p>Still, there is <i>a something which we cannot know</i>, a
secret into which we cannot pry. I repeat what I have
said before: you cannot look into men's inward parts
and see exactly how the truth takes hold upon the
heart, or the heart takes hold upon the truth. Many have
watched their own feelings till they have become blind
with despondency, and others have watched the feelings
of the young till they have done them rather harm
than good by their rigorous supervision. In God's
work there is more room for faith than for sight. The
heavenly seed grows secretly. You must bury it out of
sight, or there will be no harvest. Even if you keep the
seed above ground, and it does sprout, you cannot
discover <i>how</i> it grows; even though you microscopically
watched its swelling and bursting, you could not see
the inward vital force which moves the seed. Thou
knowest not the way of the Spirit. His work is wrought
in secret. "Explain the new birth," says somebody.
My answer is, "Experience the new birth, and you
shall know what it is." There are secrets into which
we cannot enter, for their light is too bright for mortal
eyes to endure. O man, thou canst not become omniscient,
for thou art a creature, and not the Creator.
For thee there must ever be a region not only unknown
but unknowable. So far shall thy knowledge go, but
no farther; and thou mayest thank God it is so, for
thus he leaves room for faith, and gives cause for prayer.
Cry mightily unto the Great Worker to do what thou
canst not attempt to perform, that so, when thou seest
men saved, thou mayest give the Lord all the glory
evermore.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">III. Thirdly, our text tells us <span class="smcap">what we may expect
if we work for God, and what we may not expect</span>.
According to this parable <i>we may expect to see fruit</i>. The
husbandman casts his seed into the ground: the seed
springs and grows, and he naturally expects a harvest.
I wish I could say a word to stir up the expectations of
Christian workers; for I fear that many work without
faith. If you had a garden or a field, and you sow seed
in it, you would be very greatly surprised and grieved
if it did not come up at all; but many Christian people
seem quite content to work on without expectation of
result. This is a pitiful kind of working&mdash;pulling up
empty buckets by the year together. Surely, I must
either see some result for my labor and be glad, or else,
failing to see it, I must be ready to break my heart if
I be a true servant of the great Master. We ought to
have expected results; if we had expected more we
should have seen more; but a lack of expectation has
been a great cause of failure in God's workers.</p>

<p><i>But we may not expect to see all the seed which we sow
spring up the moment we sow it.</i> Sometimes, glory be to
God, we have but to deliver the word, and straightway
men are converted: the reaper overtakes the sower, in
such instances; but it is not always so. Some sowers have
been diligent for years upon their plots of ground, and
yet apparently all has been in vain; at last the harvest
has come, a harvest which, speaking after the manner of
men, had never been reaped if they had not persevered
to the end. This world, as I believe, is to be converted
to Christ; but not to-day, nor to-morrow, peradventure
not for many an age; but the sowing of the centuries is
not being lost, it is working on toward the grand ultimatum.
A crop of mushrooms may soon be produced;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
but a forest of oaks will not reward the planter till generations
of his children have mouldered in the dust. It
is ours to sow, and to hope for quick reaping; but still
we ought to remember that "the husbandman waiteth
for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience
for it, until he receive the early and latter rain,"
and so must we. We are to expect results, but not to
be dispirited if we have to wait for them.</p>

<p>We are also to expect to see the good seed grow,
but <i>not always after our fashion</i>. Like children, we are
apt to be impatient. Your little boy sowed mustard
and cress yesterday in his garden. This afternoon
Johnny will be turning over the ground to see if the
seed is growing. There is no probability that his mustard
and cress will come to anything, for he will not let
it alone long enough for it to grow. So is it with hasty
workers; they must see the result of the gospel directly,
or else they distrust the blessed word. Certain preachers
are in such a hurry that they will allow no time
for thought, no space for counting the cost, no opportunity
for men to consider their ways and turn to the
Lord with full purpose of heart. All other seeds take
time to grow, but the seed of the word must grow before
the speaker's eyes like magic, or he thinks nothing
has been done. Such good brethren are so eager to
produce blade and ear there and then, that they roast
their seed in the fire of fanaticism, and it perishes.
They make men think that they are converted, and thus
effectually hinder them from coming to a saving knowledge
of the truth. Some men are prevented from being
saved by being told that they are saved already, and by
being puffed up with a notion of perfection when they are
not even broken in heart. Perhaps if such people had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
been taught to look for something deeper they might
not have been satisfied with receiving seed on stony
ground; but now they exhibit a rapid development,
and an equally rapid decline and fall. Let us believingly
expect to see the seed grow; but let us look to see
it advance after the manner of the preacher&mdash;firstly,
secondly, thirdly: first the blade, then the ear, then
the full corn in the ear.</p>

<p>We may expect also to see the seed ripen. Our
works will by God's grace lead up to real faith in those
he hath wrought upon by his word and Spirit; but <i>we
must not expect to see it perfect at first</i>. How many mistakes
have been made here. Here is a young person under
impression, and some good, sound brother talks with
the trembling beginner, and asks profound questions.
He shakes his experienced head, and knits his furrowed
brows. He goes into the corn-field to see how the crops
are prospering, and though it is early in the year, he
laments that he cannot see an ear of corn; indeed, he
perceives nothing but mere grass. "I cannot see a
trace of corn," says he. No, brother, of course you
cannot; for you will not be satisfied with the blade as
an evidence of life, but must insist upon seeing everything
at full growth at once. If you had looked for the
blade you would have found it; and it would have encouraged
you. For my own part, I am glad even to
perceive a faint desire, a feeble longing, a degree of
uneasiness, or a measure of weariness of sin, or a craving
after mercy. Will it not be wise for you, also, to
allow things to begin at the beginning, and to be satisfied
with their being small at the first? See the blade
of desire, and then watch for more. Soon you shall see a
little more than desire; for there shall be conviction and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
resolve, and after that a feeble faith, small as a mustard
seed, but bound to grow. Do not despise the day of
small things. Do not examine the new-born babe to
see whether he is sound in doctrine after your idea of
soundness; ten to one he is a long way off sound, and
you will only worry the dear heart by introducing
difficult questions. Speak to him about his being a
sinner, and Christ a Saviour, and you will in this way
water him so that his grace in the ear will become the
full corn in the ear. It may be that there is not much
that looks like wheat about him yet; but by-and-by you
shall say, "Wheat! ah, that it is, if I know wheat.
This man is a true ear of corn, and gladly will I place
him among my Master's sheaves." If you cut down
the blades, where will the ears come from? Expect
grace in your converts; but do not look to see glory in
them just yet.</p>


<p class="p2">IV. Under the last head we shall consider <span class="smcap">what
sleep workers may take, and what they may not
take</span>; for it is said of this sowing man, that he sleeps
and rises night and day, and the seed springs and grows
up he knoweth not how. They say a farmer's trade is
a good one because it is going on while he is abed and
asleep; and surely ours is a good trade, too, when we
serve our Master by sowing good seed; for it is growing
even while we are asleep.</p>

<p>But how may a good workman for Christ lawfully
go to sleep? I answer, first, he may sleep the sleep of
<i>restfulness</i> born of confidence. You are afraid the kingdom
of Christ will not come, are you? Who asked you
to tremble for the ark of the Lord? Afraid for the
infinite Jehovah that his purposes will fail? Shame on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
you! Your anxiety dishonors your God. Shall Omnipotence
be defeated? You had better sleep than wake
to play the part of Uzzah. Rest patiently; God's purpose
will be accomplished, his kingdom will come, his
chosen will be saved, and Christ shall see of the travail
of his soul. Take the sweet sleep which God gives to
his beloved, the sleep of perfect confidence, such as Jesus
slept in the hinder part of the ship when it was tossed
with tempest. The cause of God never was in jeopardy,
and never will be; the seed sown is insured by Omnipotence,
and must produce its harvest. In patience
possess your soul, and wait till the harvest comes, for
the pleasure of the Lord must prosper in the hands of
Jesus.</p>

<p>Also take that sleep of <i>joyful expectancy</i> which leads
to a happy waking. Get up in the morning and feel
that the Lord is ruling all things for the attainment of
his own purposes, and the highest benefit of all who put
their trust in him. Look for a blessing by day, and
close your eyes at night calmly expecting to meet
with better things to-morrow. If you do not sleep you
will not wake up in the morning refreshed, and ready
for more work. If it were possible for you to sit up all
night and eat the bread of carefulness you would be unfit
to attend to the service which your Master appoints for
the morning; therefore take your rest and be at peace,
and work with calm dignity, for the matter is safe in the
Lord's hands. Is it not written, "So he giveth his
beloved sleep"?</p>

<p>Take your rest because you have consciously resigned
your work into God's hands. After you have
spoken the word, resort to God in prayer, and commit
the matter into God's hand, and then do not fret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
about it. It cannot be in better keeping, leave it with
him who worketh all in all.</p>

<p>But do not sleep the sleep of unwatchfulness.
The farmer sows his seed, but he does not therefore
forget it. He has to mend his fences, to drive away
birds, to remove weeds, or to prevent floods. He does
not watch the growth of the seed, but he has plenty else
to do. He sleeps, but it is only in due time and measure,
and is not to be confounded with the sluggard's
slumbers. He never sleeps the sleep of indifference, or
even of inaction, for each season has its demand upon
him. He has sown one field, but he has another to
sow. He has sown, but he has also to reap; and if reaping
is done, he has to thresh and to winnow. A farmer's
work is never done, for in one part or the other of the
farm he is needed. His sleep is but a pause that gives
him strength to continue his occupation. The parable
teaches us to do all that lies within our province, but
not to intrude into the domain of God: in teaching to
the era we are to labor diligently, but with regard to
the secret working of truth upon man's mind, we are
to pray and rest, looking to the Lord for the inward
power.</p>


<h2><a name="THE_SHEEP_BEFORE_THE_SHEARERS" id="THE_SHEEP_BEFORE_THE_SHEARERS">THE SHEEP BEFORE THE SHEARERS.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"As a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>
53:7.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Our</span> Lord Jesus so took our place that we are in
this chapter compared to sheep: "All we like sheep
have gone astray," and he is compared to a sheep also&mdash;"As
a sheep before her shearers is dumb." It is wonderful
how complete was the interchange of positions between
Christ and his people, so that he became what
they were in order that they might become what he is.
We can well understand how we should be the sheep
and he the shepherd; but to liken the Son of the Highest
to a sheep would have been unpardonable presumption
had not his own Spirit employed the condescending
figure.</p>

<p>Though the emblem is very gracious, its use in
this place is by no means singular, for our Lord had
been before Isaiah's day typified by the lamb of the
Passover. Since then he has been proclaimed as "the
Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world;"
and indeed even in his glory he is the Lamb in the
midst of the throne.</p>


<p class="p2">I. In opening up this divine emblem I would invite
you to consider, first, <span class="smcap">our Saviour's patience</span>, set forth
under the figure of a sheep dumb before her shearers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Lord was brought to the shearers that he
might be shorn of his comfort, and of his honor, shorn
even of his good name, and shorn at last of his life itself;
but when under the shearers he was as silent as a sheep.
How patient he was before Pilate, and Herod, and Caiaphas,
and on the cross! You have no record of his
uttering any exclamation of impatience at the pain and
shame which he received at the hands of these wicked
men. You hear not one bitter word. Pilate cries,
"Answerest thou nothing? Behold how many things
they witness against thee"; and Herod is wofully
disappointed, for he expected to see some miracle
wrought by him. All that our Lord does say is in
submissive tones, like the bleating of a sheep, though
infinitely more full of meaning. He utters sentences like
these&mdash;"For this purpose was I born, and came into the
world, that I might bear witness to the truth," and,
"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do." Otherwise he is all patience and silence.</p>

<p>Remember, first, that our Lord was dumb and
opened not his mouth <i>against his adversaries</i>, and did not
accuse one of them of cruelty or injustice. They slandered
him, but he replied not; false witnesses arose, but
he answered them not. One would have thought he must
have spoken when they spat in his face. Might he not
have said, "Friend, why doest thou this? For which
of all my works dost thou insult me?" But the time for
such expostulations was over. When they smote him on
the face with the palms of their hands, it would not have
been wonderful if he had said, "Wherefore do you
smite me so?" But no; he is as though he heard not
their revilings. He brings no accusation to his Father.
He needed only to have lifted his eye to heaven, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
legions of angels would have chased away the ribald
soldiery; one flash of a seraph's wing and Herod had
been eaten by worms, and Pilate had died the death he
well deserved as an unjust judge. The hill of the cross
might have become a volcano's mouth to swallow up
the whole multitude who stood there jesting and jeering
at him: but no, there was no display of power, or rather
there was so great a display of power over himself that
he restrained Omnipotence itself with a strength which
never can be measured.</p>

<p>Again, as he did not utter a word against his adversaries,
so he did not say a word <i>against any one of us</i>. You
remember how Zipporah said to Moses, "Surely a bloody
husband art thou to me," as she saw her child bleeding;
and surely Jesus might have said to his church, "Thou
art a costly spouse to me, to bring me all this shame
and bloodshedding." But he giveth liberally, he openeth
the very fountain of his heart, and he upbraideth
not. He had reckoned on the uttermost expenditure,
and therefore he endured the cross, despising the
shame.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"This was compassion like a God,</div>
<div class="line small i2">That when the Saviour knew,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">The price of pardon was his blood,</div>
<div class="line small i2">His pity ne'er withdrew."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>No doubt he looked across the ages; for that eye
of his was not dim, even when bloodshot on the tree:
he must have foreseen your indifference and mine, our
coldness of heart, and base unfaithfulness, and he might
have left on record some such words as these: "I am
suffering for those who are utterly unworthy of my regard;
their love will be a miserable return for mine.
Though I give my whole heart for them, how lukewarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
is their love to me! I am sick of them, I am weary of
them, and it is woe to me that I should be laying down
my heart's blood for such a worthless race as these my
people are." But there is not a hint of such a feeling.
No. "Having loved his own which were in the world,
he loved them unto the end," and he did not utter a
syllable that looked like murmuring at his suffering on
their behalf, or regretting that he had commenced the
work.</p>

<p>And again, as there was not a word against his
adversaries, nor a word against you nor me, so their
was not a word <i>against his Father</i>, nor a syllable of
repining at the severity of the chastisement laid upon
him for our sakes. You and I have murmured when
under a comparatively light grief, thinking ourselves
hardly done by. We have dared to cry out against
God, "My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids
is the shadow of death; not for any injustice in
mine hands: also my prayer is pure." But not so the
Saviour; in his mouth were no complaints. It is quite
impossible for us to conceive how the Father pressed
and bruised him, yet was there no repining. "My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" is an exclamation
of astonished grief, but it is not the voice of complaint.
It shows manhood in weakness, but not manhood in
revolt. Many are the Lamentations of Jeremiah, but
few are the lamentations of Jesus. Jesus wept, and
Jesus sweat great drops of blood, but he never murmured
nor felt rebellion in his heart.</p>

<p>Behold your Lord and Saviour lying in passive
resignation beneath the shearers, as they take away
everything that is dear to him, and yet he openeth not
his mouth. I see in this our Lord's <i>complete submission</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
He gives himself up; there is no reserve about it. The
sacrifice did not need binding with cords to the horns
of the altar. How different from your case and mine!
He stood there willing to suffer, to be spit upon, to be
shamefully entreated, and to die, for in him there was a
complete surrender. He was wholly given to do the
Father's will, and to work out our redemption. There
was <i>complete self-conquest</i> too. In him no faculty arose
to plead for liberty, and ask to be exempted from the
general strain; no limb of the body, no portion of the
mind, no faculty of the spirit started, but all submitted
to the divine will: the whole Christ gave up his whole
being unto God, that he might perfectly offer himself
without spot for our redemption.</p>

<p>There was not only self-conquest, but <i>complete absorption
in his work</i>. The sheep, lying there, thinks no more
of the pastures, it yields itself up to the shearer. The
zeal of God's house did eat up our Lord in Pilate's
hall as well as everywhere else, for there he witnessed a
good confession. No thought had he but for the clearing
of the divine honor, and the salvation of God's
elect. Brethren, I wish we could arrive at this, to submit
our whole spirit to God, to learn self-conquest, and
the delivering up of conquered self entirely to God.</p>

<p>The wonderful serenity and submissiveness of our
Lord are still better set forth by our text, if it be indeed
true that sheep in the East are even more docile than
with us. Those who have seen the noise and roughness
of many of our washings and shearings will hardly believe
the testimony of that ancient writer Philo-Judæus when
he affirms that the sheep came voluntarily to be shorn.
He says: "Woolly rams laden with thick fleeces put
themselves into the shepherd's hands to have their wool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
shorn, being thus accustomed to pay their yearly tribute
to man, their king by nature. The sheep stands in a
silent inclining posture, unconstrained under the hand
of the shearer. These things may appear strange to
those who do not know the docility of the sheep, but
they are true." Marvellous indeed was this submissiveness
in our Lord's case; let us admire and imitate.</p>


<p class="p2">II. Thus I have feebly set forth the patience of our
beloved Master. Now I want you to follow me, in the
second place, to <span class="smcap">view our own case under the same
metaphor as that which is used in reference to our
Lord</span>.</p>

<p>Did I not begin by saying that because we were
sheep he deigns to compare himself to a sheep? Let
us look from another point of view; our Lord was a
sheep under the shearers, and as he is so are we also in
this world. Though we shall never be offered up like
lambs in the temple by way of expiation, yet the saints
for ages were the flock of slaughter, as it is written,
"For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted
as sheep for the slaughter!" Jesus sends us
forth as sheep in the midst of wolves, and we are to regard
ourselves as living sacrifices, ready to be offered
up. I dwell, however, more particularly upon the second
symbol: we are brought as sheep under the shearers'
hands.</p>

<p>Just as a sheep is taken by the shearer, and its wool is
all cut off, so doth the Lord take his people and shear
them, taking away all their earthly comforts, and leaving
them bare. I wish when it came to our turn to undergo
this shearing operation it could be said of us as of
our Lord, "As a sheep before her shearers is dumb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
so he openeth not his mouth." I fear that we open our
mouths a great deal, and make no end of complaining
without any apparent cause, or with the very slenderest
reason. But now to the figure.</p>

<p>First, remember that <i>a sheep rewards its owner for all
his care and trouble by being shorn</i>. There is nothing else
that I know of that a sheep can do. It yields food when
it is killed, but while it is alive the one payment that
the sheep can make to the shepherd is to yield its fleece
in due season. Some of God's people can give to Christ
a tribute of gratitude by active service, and they should
do so gladly every day of their lives; but many others
cannot do much in active service, and about the only
reward they can give to their Lord is to render up their
fleece by suffering when he calls upon them to suffer,
submissively yielding to be shorn of their personal comfort
when the time comes for patient endurance.</p>

<p>Here comes the shearer; he takes the sheep and begins
to cut, cut, cut, cut, taking away the wool wholesale.
Affliction is often used as the big shears. The
husband, or perhaps the wife, is removed, little children
are taken away, property is shorn off, and health is
gone. Sometimes the shears cut off the man's good
name; slander follows; comforts vanish. Well, this is
your shearing time, and it may be that you are not able
to glorify God to any very large extent except by undergoing
this process. If this be the fact, do you not think
that we, like good sheep of Christ, should surrender
ourselves cheerfully, feeling, "I lay myself down with
this intent, that thou shouldst take from me anything
and everything, and do what thou wilt with me; for I
am not mine own, I am bought with a price"?</p>

<p>Notice that the sheep is itself <i>benefited by the operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of shearing</i>. Before they begin to shear the sheep the
wool is long and old, and every bush and brier tears off
a bit of the wool, until the sheep looks ragged and
forlorn.</p>

<p>If the wool were left, when the heat of summer came
the sheep would not be able to bear itself, it would be
so overloaded with clothing that it would be as uncomfortable
as we are when we have kept on our borrowed
wool, our flannels and broadcloths, too late. So, brethren,
when the Lord shears us, we do not like the operation
any more than the sheep do; but first, it is for <i>his
glory</i>; and secondly, it is for <i>our benefit</i>, and therefore
we are bound most willingly to submit. There are many
things which we should have liked to have kept which, if
we had kept them, would not have proved blessings but
curses. A stale blessing is a curse. The manna, though
it came from heaven, was only good so long as God's
command made it a blessing, but when they kept it over
its due time it bred worms and stank, and then it was
no blessing. Many persons would keep their mercies
till they turn to corruption; but God will not have it so.
Up to a certain point for you to be wealthy was a blessing;
it would not have been a blessing any longer, and
so the Lord took your riches away. Up to that point
your child was a boon, but it would have been no longer
so, and therefore it fell sick and died. You may not be
able to see it, but it is so, that God, when he withdraws
a blessing from his people, takes it away because it
would not be a blessing any longer.</p>

<p>Before sheep are shorn <i>they are always washed</i>. Were
you ever present at the scene when they drive them
down to the brook? Men are placed in rows, leading
to the shepherd who stands in the water. The sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
are driven down, and the men seize them, throw
them into the pool, keeping their faces above water,
and swirl them round and round and round to
wash the wool before they clip it off. You see
them come out on the other side frightened to death,
poor things, wondering whatever is coming. I want
to suggest to you, brethren, that whenever a trial
threatens to overtake you, you should entreat the Lord
to sanctify it to you. If the good Shepherd is going to
clip your wool, ask him to wash it before he takes it off;
ask to be cleansed in spirit, soul, and body. That is a
very good custom Christian people have of asking a
blessing on their meals before they eat bread. Do you
not think it is even more necessary to ask a blessing on
our troubles before we get into them? Here is your
dear child likely to die; will you not, dear parents,
meet together and ask God to bless the death of that
child, if it is to happen? The harvest fails; would it not
be well to say&mdash;"Lord, sanctify this poverty, this loss,
this year's bad harvest: cause it to be a means of grace
to us." Why not ask a blessing on the cup of bitterness
as well as upon the cup of thanksgiving? Ask to be
washed before you are shorn, and if the shearing must
come, let it be your chief concern to yield clean wool.</p>

<p>After the washing, when the sheep has been dried,
it actually <i>loses what was its comfort</i>. The sheep is thrown
down, and the shearers get to work; the poor creature
is losing its comfortable fleece. You also will have to
part with your comforts. Will you recollect this?
The next time you receive a fresh blessing call it a
loan. Poor sheep, there is no wool on your back but
what will have to come off; child of God, there is no
earthly comfort in your possession but what will either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
leave you, or you will leave it. Nothing is our own
except our God. "Why," says one, "not our sin?"
Sin was our own, but Jesus has taken it upon himself,
and it is gone. There is nothing our own but our God,
for all his gifts are held on lease, terminable at his
sovereign will. We foolishly consider that our mercies
belong to us, and when the Lord takes them away we
half grumble. A loan, they say, should go laughing
home, and so should we rejoice when the Lord takes back
that which he had lent us. All our possessions are but
brief favors borrowed for the hour. As the sheep yields
up its wool and so loses its comfort, so must we yield
up all our earthly properties; or if they remain with us
till we die, we shall part with them then, we shall not
take so much as one of them across the stream of death.</p>

<p>The shearers <i>take care not to hurt the sheep</i>; they clip
as close as they can, but they do not cut the skin. If
possible, they will not draw blood, even in the smallest
degree. When they do make a gash, it is because the
sheep does not lie still; but a careful shearer has bloodless
shears. Of this Thomson sings in his "Seasons,"
and the passage is so good an illustration of the whole
subject that I will adorn my discourse with it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"How meek, how patient, the mild creature lies!</div>
<div class="line small ip5">What softness in its melancholy face,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">What dumb complaining innocence appears!</div>
<div class="line small ip5">Fear not, ye gentle tribes! 'tis not the knife</div>
<div class="line small ip5">Of horrid slaughter that is o'er you waved;</div>
<div class="line small ip5">No, 'tis the tender swain's well guided shears,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">Who having now, to pay his annual care,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">Borrow'd your fleece, to you a cumbrous load,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">Will send you bounding to your hills again."</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>It is the kicking and the struggling that make the
shearing work at all hard, but if we are dumb before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the shearers no harm can come. The Lord may clip
wonderfully close; I have known him clip some so close
that they did not seem to have a bit of wool left, for
they were stripped entirely, even as Job when he cried,
"Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
shall I return thither." Still, like Job, they have added,
"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;
blessed be the name of the Lord."</p>

<p>Notice that the shearers always <i>shear at a suitable
time</i>. It would be a very wicked, cruel, and unwise
thing to begin sheep-shearing in winter time. There is a
proverb which talks about God "tempering the wind to
the shorn lamb." It may be so, but it is a very cruel
practice to shear lambs while winds need tempering.
Sheep are shorn when it is warm, genial weather, when
they can afford to lose their fleeces, and are all the
better for being relieved of them. As the summer comes
on sheep-shearing time comes. Have you ever noticed
that whenever the Lord afflicts us he selects the best
possible time? There is a prayer that he puts into his
disciples' mouths, "Pray that your flight be not in the
winter;" the spirit of that prayer may be seen in the
seasonableness of our sorrows. He will not send us our
worst troubles at our worst times. If your soul is depressed
the Lord does not send you a very heavy burden;
he reserves such a load for times when you have joy in
the Lord to be your strength. It has come to be a kind
of feeling with us that when we have much delight a
trial is near, but when sorrow thickens deliverance is
approaching. The Lord does not send us two burdens
at a time; or, if he does, he sends double strength.
His shearing time is chosen with tender discretion.</p>

<p>There is another thing to remember. It is with us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
as with the sheep, <i>there is new wool coming</i>. Whenever
the Lord takes away our earthly comforts with one
hand, one, two, three, he restores with the other hand
six, a score, a hundred; we are crying and whining
about the little loss, and yet it is necessary in order that
we may be able to receive the great gain. Yes, it will
be so, we shall have cause for rejoicing, "joy cometh
in the morning." If we have lost one position, there is
another for us; if we have been driven out of one
place, a better refuge is prepared. Providence opens a
second door when it shuts the first. If the Lord takes
away the manna, as he did from his people Israel, it is
because they have the old corn of the land of Canaan
to live upon. If the water of the rock did not follow
the tribes any longer, it was because they drank of the
Jordan, and of the brooks. O sheep of the Lord's fold,
there is new wool coming: therefore do not fret at the
shearing. I have given these thoughts in brief, that we
may come to the last word.</p>


<p class="p2">III. Let us, in the third place, endeavor to <span class="smcap">imitate
the example of our blessed Lord when our turn comes
to be shorn</span>. Let us be dumb before the shearers, submissive,
quiescent, even as he was.</p>

<p>I have been giving, in everything I have said, a
reason for so doing. I have shown that our shearing
by affliction glorifies God, rewards the Shepherd,
and benefits ourselves. I have shown that the Lord
measures and tempers our affliction, and sends the trial
at the right time. I have shown you in many ways that
it will be wise to submit ourselves as the sheep does to
the shearer, and that the more completely we do so the
better.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>We struggle far too much, and we are apt to make
excuses for so doing. Sometimes we say, "Oh, this is
so painful, I cannot be patient! I could have borne anything
else but this." When a father is going to correct
his child, does he select something pleasant? No.
The painfulness of the punishment is the essence of it,
and even so the bitterness of our sorrow is the soul of our
chastening. By the blueness of the wound the heart
will be made better. Do not repine because your trial
seems strange and sharp. That would in fact be saying,
"If I have it all my own way I will, but if everything
does not please me I will rebel;" and that is not a fit
spirit for a child of God.</p>

<p>Sometimes we complain because of our great weakness.
"Lord, were I stronger I would not mind this
heavy loss; but I am frail as a sere leaf driven of the
tempest." But who is to be the judge of the suitability
of your trial? You or God? Since the Lord judges this
trial to be suitable to your weakness, you may be sure
that it is so. Lie still! Lie still! "Alas," you say,
"my grief comes from the most cruel quarter; this
trouble did not arise directly from God, it came through
my cousin or my brother who ought to have treated me
with gratitude. It was not an enemy; then I could
have borne it." My brother, let me assure you that in
reality trial comes not from an enemy after all. God is
at the bottom of all your tribulation; look through the
second causes to the great First Cause. It is a great
mistake when we fret over the human instrument which
smites us, and forget the hand which uses the rod. If
I strike a dog, he bites my stick; poor creature, he
knows no better; but if he could think a little he would
bite <i>me</i>, or else take the blow submissively. Now, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
must not begin biting the stick. After all, it is your
heavenly Father that uses the staff; though it be of
ebony or of blackthorn, it is in his hand. It is well to
have done with picking and choosing our trials, and
to leave the whole matter in the hand of infinite wisdom.
A sweet singer has put this matter very prettily; let
me quote the lines:</p>

<p>This is the pith of my sermon: oh, believer, yield
thyself! Lie passive in the hands of God! Yield thee,
and struggle not! There is no use in struggling, for our
great Shearer, if he means to shear, will do it. Did I
not say just now that the sheep, by struggling, might
be cut by the shears? So you and I, if we struggle
against God, will get two strokes instead of one; and
after all there is not half so much trouble in a trouble
as there is in kicking against the trouble. The Eastern
ploughman has a goad, and pricks the ox to make it move
more actively; he does not hurt it much by his gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
prodding, but suppose the ox flings out its leg the
moment it touches him, he drives the goad into himself,
and bleeds. So it is with us, we shall find it hard to
kick against the pricks; we shall endure much more
pain by rebelling than would have come if we had yielded
to the divine will. What good comes of fretting?
We cannot make one hair white or black. You that are
troubled, rest with us, for you cannot make shower or
shine, foul or fair, with all your groaning. Did you
ever bring a penny into the till by fretting, or put a loaf
on the table by complaint? Murmuring is wasted
breath, and fretting is wasted time. To lie passive in
the hand of God brings a blessing to the soul. I would
myself be more quiet, calm, and self-possessed. I long
to cry habitually, "Lord, do what thou wilt, when thou
wilt, as thou wilt, with me, thy servant; appoint me
honor or dishonor, wealth or poverty, sickness or health,
exhilaration or depression, and I will take all right
gladly from thy hand." A man is not far from the
gates of heaven when he is fully submissive to the
Lord's will.</p>

<p>You that have been shorn have, I hope, received
comfort through the ever blessed Spirit of God. May
God bless you. Oh that the sinner, too, would humble
himself under the mighty hand of God! Submit
yourselves unto God, let every thought be brought into
captivity to him, and the Lord send his blessing, for
Christ's sake. Amen.</p>


<h2><a name="IN_THE_HAY-FIELD" id="IN_THE_HAY-FIELD">IN THE HAY-FIELD.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> 104:14.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">At</span> the appointed season all the world is busy with
ingathering the grass crop, and you can scarcely ride a
mile in the country without scenting the delicious fragrance
of the new-mown hay, and hearing the sharpening
of the mower's scythe. There is a gospel in the
hay-field, and that gospel we intend to bring out as we
may be enabled by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Our text conducts us at once to the spot, and we
shall therefore need no preface. "He causeth the grass
to grow for the cattle"&mdash;three things we shall notice;
first, that <i>grass is in itself instructive</i>; secondly, that <i>grass
is far more so when God is seen in it</i>; and thirdly, that <i>by
the growth of grass for the cattle, the ways of grace may be
illustrated</i>.</p>


<p class="p2">I. First, then, "He causeth the grass to grow for
the cattle." Here we have <span class="smcap">something which is in itself
instructive</span>. Scarcely any emblem, with the exception
of water and light, is more frequently used by
inspiration than the grass of the field.</p>

<p>In the first place, the grass may be instructively
looked upon as <i>the symbol of our mortality</i>. "All flesh is
grass." The whole history of man may be seen in the
meadow. He springs up green and tender, subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the frosts of infancy, which imperil his young life; he
grows, he comes to maturity, he puts on beauty even as
the grass is adorned with flowers; but after a while his
strength departs and his beauty is wrinkled, even as
the grass withers and is followed by a fresh generation,
which withers in its turn. Like ourselves, the grass
ripens but to decay. The sons of men come to maturity
in due time, and then decline and wither as the
green herb. Some of the grass is not left to come to
ripeness at all, but the mower's scythe removes it, even
as swift-footed death overtakes the careless children
of Adam. "In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth
up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. For
we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are
we troubled." "As for man, his days are as grass:
as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind
passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof
shall know it no more." This is very humbling; and
we need frequently to be reminded of it, or we dream
of immortality beneath the stars. We ought never to
tread upon the grass without remembering that whereas
the green sod covers our graves, it also reminds us of
them, and preaches by every blade a sermon to us concerning
our mortality, of which the text is, "All flesh
is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower
of the field."</p>

<p>In the second place, grass is frequently used in
Scripture as <i>an emblem of the wicked</i>. David tells us from
his own experience that the righteous man is apt to
grow envious of the wicked when he sees the prosperity
of the ungodly. We have seen them spreading themselves
like green bay trees, and apparently fixed and
rooted in their places; and when we have smarted under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
our own troubles, and felt that all the day long we were
scourged, and chastened every morning, we have been
apt to say, "How can this be consistent with the righteous
government of God?" We are reminded by the
Psalmist that in a short time we shall pass by the place
of the wicked, and lo, he shall not be; we shall diligently
consider his place, and lo, it shall not be; for he is soon
cut down as the grass, and withereth as the green herb.
The grass withereth, the flower thereof fadeth away,
and even so shall pass away forever the glory of those
who build upon the estate of time, and dig for lasting
comfort in the mines of the earth. As the Eastern husbandman
gathers up the green herb, and, despite its
former beauty, casts it into the furnace, such must be
your lot, O vainglorious sinners! Thus will the judge
command his angels, "Bind them in bundles to burn."
Where now your merriment? Where now your confidence?
Where now your pride and your pomp? Where
now your boastings and your loud-mouthed blasphemies?
They are silent for ever; for, as thorns crackle
under a pot, but are speedily consumed, and leave
nothing except a handful of ashes, so shall it be with the
wicked as to this life; the fire of God's wrath shall devour
them.</p>

<p>It is more pleasing to recollect that the grass is used
in Scripture as <i>a picture of the elect of God</i>. The wicked
are comparable to the dragons of the wilderness, but
God's own people shall spring up in their place, for it
is written, "In the habitation of dragons, where each
lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes." The elect are
compared to grass, because of their number as they shall
be in the latter days, and because of the rapidity of their
growth. You remember the passage, "There shall be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains:
the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and
they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth."
O that the long expected day might soon come, when
God's people shall no longer be like a lone tuft of grass,
but when they shall spring up as among the grass, as
"willows by the water-courses." Grass and willows are
two of the fastest growing things we know of; so shall
a nation be born in a day, so shall crowds be converted
at once; for when the Spirit of God shall be mightily
at work in the midst of the church, men shall fly unto
Christ as doves fly to their dovecots, so that the astonished
church shall exclaim, "These, where had they
been?" O that we might live to see the age of gold,
the time which prophets have foretold, when the company
of God's people shall be innumerable as the blades
of grass in the meadows, and grace and truth shall
flourish.</p>

<p>How like the grass are God's people for this reason,
that they are absolutely dependent upon the influences
of heaven! Our fields are parched if vernal showers
and gentle dews are withheld, and what are our souls
without the gracious visitations of the Spirit? Sometimes
through severe trials our wounded hearts are like
the mown grass, and then we have the promise, "He
shall come down like rain upon the mown grass; as
showers that water the earth." Our sharp troubles
have taken away our beauty, and lo, the Lord visits us,
and we revive again. Thank God for that old saying,
which is a gracious doctrine as well as a true proverb,
"Each blade of grass has its own drop of dew." God
is pleased to give his own peculiar mercies to each one
of his own servants. "Thy blessing is upon thy people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Once again, grass is comparable to <i>the food where-with
the Lord supplies the necessities of his chosen ones</i>. Take
the twenty-third Psalm, and you have the metaphor
worked out in the sweetest form of pastoral song: "He
maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth
me beside the still waters." Just as the sheep has
nourishment according to its nature, and this nourishment
is abundantly found for it by its shepherd, so that
it not only feeds, but then lies down in the midst of
the fodder, satiated with plenty, and perfectly content
and at ease; even so are the people of God when Jesus
Christ leads them into the pastures of the covenant,
and opens up to them the precious truths upon which
their souls shall be fed. Beloved, have we not proved
that promise true, "In this mountain shall the Lord of
hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast
of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of
wines on the lees well refined"? My soul has sometimes
fed upon Christ till I have felt as if I could receive
no more, and then I have laid me down in the
bounty of my God to take my rest, satisfied with favor,
and full of the goodness of the Lord.</p>

<p>Thus, you see, the grass itself is not without instruction
for those who will incline their ear.</p>


<p class="p2">II. In the second place, <span class="smcap">God is seen in the
growing of the grass</span>. He is seen first as a worker,
"He <i>causeth</i> the grass to grow." He is seen secondly
as a caretaker, "He causeth the grass to grow <i>for the
cattle</i>."</p>

<p>1. First, as a <i>worker</i>, God is to be seen in every
blade of grass, if we have but eyes to discern him. A
blind world this, which always talks about "natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
laws," and "the effects of natural causes," but forgets
that laws cannot operate of themselves, and that natural
causes, so called, are not causes at all unless the First
Cause shall set them in motion. The old Romans used to
say, <i>God</i> thundered; <i>God</i> rained. We say <i>it</i> thunders;
<i>it</i> rains. What "it"? All these expressions are subterfuges
to escape from the thought of God. We commonly
say, "How wonderful are the works of <i>nature</i>!"
What is "nature"? Do you know what <i>nature</i> is? I
remember a lecturer in the street, an infidel, speaking
about nature, and he was asked by a Christian man
standing by whether he would tell him what nature was.
He never gave a reply. The production of grass is not
the result of natural law apart from the actual work of
God; mere law would be inoperative unless the great
Master himself sent a thrill of power through the matter
which is regulated by the law&mdash;unless, like the steam
engine, which puts force into all the spinning-jennies
and wheels of a cotton mill, God himself were the
motive power to make every wheel revolve. I find rest
on the grass as on a royal couch, now that I know that
my God is there at work for his creatures.</p>

<p>Having asked you to see God as a worker, I want you
to make use of this&mdash;therefore I bid you to see God in
<i>common things</i>. He makes the grass to grow&mdash;grass is a
common thing. You see it everywhere, yet God is in it.
Dissect it and pull it to pieces; the attributes of God
are illustrated in every single flower of the field, and in
every green leaf. In like manner see God in your
common matters, your daily afflictions, your common
joys, your everyday mercies. Do not say, "I must
see a miracle before I see God." In truth everything
teems with marvel. See God in the bread of your table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and the water of your cup. It will be the happiest way
of living if you can say in each providential circumstance,
"My Father has done all this." See God
also in <i>little things</i>. The little things of life are the
greatest troubles. A man will hear that his house is
burned down more quietly than he will see an ill-cooked
joint of meat upon his table, when he reckoned upon its
being done to a turn. It is the <i>little</i> stone in the shoe
which makes the pilgrim limp. To see God in little
things, to believe that there is as much the presence of
God in a limb falling from the elm as in the avalanche
which crushes a village; to believe that the guidance
of every drop of spray, when the wave breaks on the
rock, is as much under the hand of God, as the steerage
of the mightiest planet in its course; to see God in the
little as well as in the great&mdash;all this is true wisdom.</p>

<p>Think, too, of God working among <i>solitary things</i>;
for grass does not merely grow where men take care of
it, but up there on the side of the lone Alp, where no
traveller has ever passed. Where only the eye of the
wild bird has beheld their lonely verdure, moss and
grass display their beauty; for God's works are fair to
other eyes than those of mortals. And you, solitary child
of God, dwelling, unknown and obscure, in a remote
hamlet; you are not forgotten by the love of heaven.
He maketh the grass to grow all alone, and shall
he not make you flourish despite your loneliness?
He can bring forth your graces and educate you
for the skies in solitude and neglect. The grass,
you know, is a thing we tread upon, nobody thinks
of its being crushed by the foot, and yet God makes
it grow. Perhaps you are oppressed and down-trodden,
but let not this depress your spirit, for God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
executeth righteousness for all those that are oppressed;
he maketh the grass to grow, and he can make
your heart to flourish under all the oppressions and
afflictions of life, so that you shall still be happy and
holy though all the world marches over you; still living
in the immortal life which God himself bestows upon
you, though hell itself set its heel upon you. Poor and
needy one, unknown, unobserved, oppressed and down-trodden,
God makes the grass to grow, and he will
take care of you.</p>

<p>2. But I said we should see in the text God also as
a great <i>caretaker</i>. "He causeth the grass to grow <i>for
the cattle</i>." "Doth God take care for oxen? Or saith
he it altogether for our sakes?" "Thou shalt not
muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn,"
shows that God has a care for the beasts of the field; but
it shows much more than that, namely that he would
have those who work for him feed as they work. God
cares for the beasts, and makes grass to grow for them.
Then, my soul, though sometimes thou hast said with
David, "So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a
beast before thee," yet God cares for thee. "He giveth
to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
cry"&mdash;there you have an instance of his care for birds,
and here we have his care for beasts; and though you,
my hearer, may seem to yourself to be as black and
defiled as a raven, and as far from anything spiritually
good as the beasts, yet take comfort from this text; he
gives grass to the cattle, and he will give grace to you,
though you think yourself to be as a beast before him.</p>

<p>Observe, he cares for these beasts who are <i>helpless</i>
as to caring for themselves. The cattle could not plant
the grass, nor cause it to grow. Though they can do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
nothing in the matter, yet he does it all for them; <i>he</i>
causeth the grass to grow. You who are as helpless as
cattle to help yourselves, who can only stand and moan
out your misery, but know not what to do, God can
prevent you in his loving-kindness, and favor you in
his tenderness. Let the bleatings of your prayer go up
to heaven, let the meanings of your desires go up to
him, and help shall come to you though you cannot help
yourselves. Beasts are <i>dumb, speechless things</i>, yet God
makes the grass grow for them. Will he hear those that
cannot speak, and will he not hear those who can?
Since our God views with kind consideration the cattle
in the field, he will surely have compassion upon his
own sons and daughters when they desire to seek
his face.</p>

<p>There is this also to be said, God not only cares for
cattle, but <i>the food</i> which he provides for them is fit food&mdash;he
causeth <i>grass</i> to grow for the cattle, just the sort
of food which ruminants require. Even thus the Lord
God provides fit sustenance for his people. Depend
upon him by faith and wait upon him in prayer, and
you shall have food convenient for you. You shall find
in God's mercy just that which your nature demands,
suitable supplies for peculiar wants.</p>

<p>This "convenient" food the Lord takes care to reserve
for the cattle, for no one eats the cattle's food but
the cattle. There is grass for them, and nobody else
cares for it, and thus it is kept for them; even so God
has a special food for his own people; "the secret of the
Lord is with them that fear him, and he will show them
his covenant." Though the grass be free to all who
choose to eat it, yet no creature careth for it except the
cattle for whom it is prepared; and though the grace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
God be free to all men, yet no man careth for it except
the elect of God, for whom he prepared it, and whom
he prepares to receive it. There is as much reserve
of the grass for the cattle as if there were walls around
it; and so, though the grace of God be free, and there be
no bound set about it, yet it is as much reserved as if it
were restricted.</p>

<p>God is seen in the grass as the worker and the caretaker;
then <i>let us see his hand in providence at all times</i>.
Let us see it, not only when we have abundance, but
even when we have scant supplies; for the grass is preparing
for the cattle even in the depth of winter. And
you, ye sons of sorrow, in your trials and troubles, are
still cared for by God; he will accomplish his own
divinely gracious purposes in you; only be still and see
the salvation of God. Every winter's night has a direct
connection with the joyous days of mowing and reaping,
and each time of grief is linked to future joy.</p>


<p class="p2">III. Our third head is most interesting. <span class="smcap">God's
working in the grass for the cattle gives us illustrations
concerning grace.</span></p>

<p>I will soliloquize, and say to myself as I read the
text, "He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle. In
this I perceive a satisfying provision for that form of
creature. I am also a creature, but I am a nobler creature
than the cattle. I cannot imagine for a moment
that God will provide all that the cattle need and not
provide for me. But naturally I feel uneasy; I cannot
find in this world what I want&mdash;if I were to win all its
riches I should still be discontented; and when I have all
that heart could wish of time's treasures, yet still my
heart feels as if it were empty. There must be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>where
or other something that will satisfy me as a man
with an immortal soul. God altogether satisfies the ox;
he must therefore have something or other that would
altogether satisfy me if I could get it. There is the
grass, the cattle get it, and when they have eaten their
share, they lie down and seem perfectly contented; now,
all I have ever found on earth has never satisfied me so
that I could lie down and be satisfied; there must, then,
be something somewhere that would content me if I
could get at it." Is not this good reasoning? I ask
both the Christian and the unbeliever to go with me
so far; but then let us proceed another step: The
cattle do get what they want&mdash;not only is the grass provided,
but they get it. Why should not I obtain what
I want? I find my soul hungering and thirsting after
something more than I can see with my eyes or hear with
my ears; there must be something to satisfy my soul,
why should I not find it? The cattle pasture upon that
which satisfies them; why should not I obtain satisfaction
too? Then I begin to pray, "O Lord, satisfy my
mouth with good things, and renew my youth."</p>

<p>While I am praying I also meditate and think&mdash;God
has provided for cattle that which is consonant to
their nature; they are nothing but flesh, and flesh is
grass, there is therefore grass for their flesh. I also am
flesh, but I am something else beside; I am spirit, and
to satisfy me I need spiritual meat. Where is it?
When I turn to God's word, I find there that though
the grass withereth, the word of the Lord endureth for
ever; and the word which Jesus speaks unto us is spirit
and life. "Oh! then," I say, "here is spiritual food
for my spiritual nature, I will rejoice therein." O may
God help me to know what that spiritual meat is, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
enable me to lay hold upon it, for I perceive that though
God provides the grass for the cattle, <i>the cattle must eat
it themselves</i>. They are not fed if they refuse to eat. I
must imitate the cattle, and receive that which God provides
for me. What do I find provided in Scripture?
I am told that the Lord Jesus came into this world to
suffer, and bleed, and die instead of me, and that if I
trust in him I shall be saved; and, being saved, the
thoughts of his love will give solace and joy to me and
be my strength. What have I to do but to feed on these
truths? I do not find the cattle bringing any preparation
to the pasture except hunger, but they enter it and
partake of their portion. Even so must I by an act of
faith live upon Jesus. Lord, give me grace to feed upon
Christ; make me hungry and thirsty after him; give
me the faith by which I may be a receiver of him, that
so I may be satisfied with favor, and full of the goodness
of the Lord.</p>

<p>My text, though it looked small, grows as we meditate
upon it. I want to introduce you to a few more
illustrations of divine grace. <i>Preventing grace may here
be seen in a symbol.</i> Grass grew before cattle were made.
We find in the first chapter of Genesis that God provided
the grass before he created the cattle. And what
a mercy that covenant supplies for God's people were
prepared before they were born. God had given his
Son Jesus Christ to be the Saviour of his chosen before
Adam fell; long before sin came into the world the
everlasting mercy of God foresaw the ruin of sin, and
provided a refuge for every elect soul. What a thought
it is for me, that, before I hunger, God has prepared the
manna; before I thirst, God has caused the rock in the
wilderness to send forth crystal streams to satisfy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
thirst of my soul! See what sovereign grace can do!
Before the cattle come to the pasture the grass has grown
for them, and before I feel my need of divine mercy that
mercy is provided for me. Then I perceive an illustration
of free grace, for <i>when the ox comes into the field he brings no
money with him</i>. So I, a poor needy sinner, having
nothing, come and receive Christ without money and
without price. The Lord maketh the grass to grow for
the cattle, and so doth he provide grace for my needy
soul, though I have now no money, no virtue, no excellence
of my own.</p>

<p>And why is it, my friends, why is it that God gives
the cattle the grass? The reason is, <i>because they belong
to him</i>. Here is a text to prove it. "The silver and the
gold are mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills."
God provides grass for his own cattle, and grace is provided
for God's people. Of every herd of cattle in the
world, God could say, "They are mine." Long before
the grazier puts his brand on the bullock God has set his
creating mark upon it; so, before the stamp of Adam's
fall was set upon our brow, the stamp of electing love
was set there: "In thy book all my members were written,
which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet
there was none of them."</p>

<p>God also feeds cattle because <i>he has entered into a
covenant with them to do so</i>. "What! a covenant with
the cattle!" says somebody. Ay! truly so, for when
God spake to his servant Noah, in that day when all the
cattle came out of the ark, we find him saying, "I establish
my covenant with you, and with your seed after
you; and with every living creature that is with you,
of the fowl, of <i>the cattle</i>, and of every beast of the earth
with you." Thus a covenant was made with the cattle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and that covenant was that seed-time and harvest should
not fail; therefore the earth brings forth for them, and
for them the Lord causeth the grass to grow. Does
Jehovah keep his covenant with cattle, and will he not
keep his covenant with his own beloved? Ah! it is
because his chosen people are his covenanted ones in the
person of the Lord Jesus, that he provides for them
all things that they shall need in time and in eternity,
and satisfies them out of the fulness of his everlasting
love.</p>

<p>Once, again, God feeds the cattle, and then <i>the cattle
praise him</i>. We find David saying, in the hundred and
forty-eighth Psalm, "Praise the Lord ... ye beasts
and all cattle." The Lord feeds his people to the
end that their glory may sing praise unto him and not
be silent. While other creatures give glory to God, let
the redeemed of the Lord especially say so, whom he
has redeemed out of the hand of the enemy.</p>

<p>Nor even yet is our text exhausted. Turning one
moment from the cattle, I want you to notice the grass.
It is said of the grass, "<i>He causeth</i> the grass to grow":
here is a doctrinal lesson, for if grass does not grow
without God's causing it to grow, how could grace arise
in the human heart apart from divine operations?
Surely grace is a much more wonderful product of divine
wisdom than the grass can be! And if grass does not
grow without a divine cause, depend upon it grace does
not dwell in us without a divine implantation. If I have
so much as one blade of grace growing within me, I
must trace it all to God's divine will, and render to him
all the glory.</p>

<p>Again, if God thinks it worth his while to make
grass, and take care of it, much more will he think it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
his honor to cause his grace to grow in our hearts. If
the great invisible Spirit, whose thoughts are high and
lofty, condescends to look after that humble thing
which grows by the hedge, surely he will condescend to
watch over his own nature, which he calls "the incorruptible
seed, which liveth and abideth for ever!"
Mungo Park, in the deserts of Africa, was much comforted
when he took up a little piece of moss, and saw
the wisdom and power of God in that lonely piece of
verdant loveliness. So, when you see the fields ripe
and ready for the mower, your hearts should leap for
joy to see how God has produced the grass, caring for
it all through the rigorous cold of winter, and the chill
months of spring, until at last he sent the genial rain
and sunshine, and brought the fields to their best condition.
And so, my soul, though thou mayest endure
many a frost of sorrow and a long winter of trial, yet
the Lord will cause thee to grow in grace, and in the
knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; to
whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>


<h2><a name="THE_JOY_OF_HARVEST" id="THE_JOY_OF_HARVEST">THE JOY OF HARVEST.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"They joy before thee according to the joy in harvest."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> 9:3.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> other day I kept the feast with a company who
shouted "Harvest Home." I was glad to see the rich
and poor rejoicing together; and when the cheerful
meal was ended, I was glad to turn one of the tables
into a pulpit, and in the large barn to preach the gospel
of the ever-blessed God to an earnest audience. My
heart was merry in harmony with the occasion, and I
shall now keep in the same key, and talk to you a little
upon the joy of harvest. Londoners forget that it is
harvest time; living in this great desert of dingy bricks
we hardly know what a wheat-ear is like, except as we
see it dry and white in the window of a corn dealer's
shop; yet let us all remember that there is such a season
as harvest, when by God's goodness the fruits of the
earth are gathered in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What is the joy of harvest</span> which is here taken as
the simile of the joy of the saints before God? I am
afraid that to the mere selfish order of spirits the joy of
harvest is simply that of personal gratification at the increase
of wealth. Sometimes the farmer only rejoices
because <i>he sees the reward of his toils</i>, and is so much the
richer man. I hope that with many there mingles the
second cause of joy; namely, gratitude to God that an
abundant harvest will give bread to the poor, and remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
complaining from our streets. There is a lawful joy in
harvest, no doubt, to the man who is enriched by it;
for any man who works hard has a right to rejoice
when at last he gains his desire. It would be well if
men would always recollect that their last and greatest
harvest will be to them according to their labor. He that
soweth to the flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, and
only the man that soweth to the spirit will of the spirit
reap life everlasting. Many a young man commences
life by sowing what he calls his wild oats, which he had
better never have sown, for they will bring him a
terrible harvest. He expects that from these wild
oats he will gather a harvest of true pleasure, but it
cannot be; the truest pleasures of life spring from the
good seed of righteousness, and not from the hemlock
of sin. As a man who sows thistles in his furrows must
not expect to reap the golden wheatsheaf, so he who
follows the ways of vice must not expect happiness.
On the contrary, if he sows the wind he will reap the
whirlwind. When a sinner feels the pangs of conscience
he may well say, "This is what I sowed." When he
shall at last receive the punishment of his evil deeds he
will blame no one but himself; he sowed tares and he
must reap tares. On the other hand, the Christian man,
though his salvation is not of works, but of grace, will
have a gracious reward given to him by his Master. Sowing
in tears, he shall reap in joy. Putting out his
talents to interest, he shall enter into his Master's joy,
and hear him say, "Well done, good and faithful
servant." The joy of harvest in part consists of the reward
of labor; may such be our joy in serving the Lord.</p>

<p>The joy of harvest has another element in it, namely,
that of <i>gratitude to God for favors bestowed</i>. We are singu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>larly
dependent on God; far more so than most of us
imagine. When the children of Israel were in the wilderness
they went forth every morning and gathered the
manna. Our manna does not come to us every morning,
but it comes once a year. It is as much a heavenly
supply as if it lay like a hoarfrost round about the
camp. If we went out into the field and gathered food
which dropped from the clouds we should think it a
great miracle; and is it not as great a marvel that our
bread should come up from the earth as that it should
come down from the sky? The same God who bade
the heavens drop with angels' food bids the dull earth
in its due season yield corn for mankind. Therefore
whenever we find that harvest comes, let us be grateful
to God, and let us not suffer the season to pass over
without psalms of thanksgiving. I believe I shall be
correct if I say that there is never in the world, as a
rule, more than sixteen months' supply of food; that
is to say, when the harvest is gathered in, there may be
sixteen months' supply; but at the time of harvest
there is not usually enough wheat in the whole world to
last the population more than four or five months; so
that if the harvest did not come we should be on the
verge of famine. We live still from hand to mouth.
Let us pause and bless God, and let the joy of harvest
be the joy of gratitude.</p>

<p>To the Christian it should be great joy, by means
of the harvest, <i>to receive an assurance of God's faithfulness</i>.
The Lord has promised that seed-time and harvest,
summer and winter, shall never cease; and when you
see the loaded wain carrying in the crop you may say to
yourself, "God is true to his promise. Despite the
dreary winter and the damp spring, autumn has come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
with its golden grain." Depend upon it, that as the
Lord keeps this promise he will keep all the rest. All
his promises are yea and amen in Christ Jesus; if he
keeps his covenant to the earth, much more will he keep
his covenant with his own people, whom he hath loved
with an everlasting love. Go, Christian, to the mercy-seat
with the promise on your lip and plead it. Be assured
it is not a dead letter. Let not unbelief cause you
to stammer when you mention the promise before the
throne, but say it boldly&mdash;"Fulfil this word unto thy
servant on which thou hast caused me to hope."
Shame upon us that we so little believe our God. The
world is full of proofs of his goodness. Every rising
sun, every falling shower, every revolving season certifies
his faithfulness. Wherefore do we doubt him? If we
never doubt him till we have cause for it we shall never
know distrust again. Encouraged by the return of
harvest, let us resolve in the strength of the Spirit of God
that we will not waver, but will believe in the divine
word and rejoice in it.</p>

<p>Once more. To the Christian, in the joy of
harvest there will always be <i>the joy of expectation</i>. As
there is a harvest to the husbandman for which he
waiteth patiently, so there is a harvest for all faithful
waiters who are looking for the coming and the appearing
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. The mature
Christian, like the ripe ear of corn, hangs down his
head with holy humility. When he was but green in
the things of God he stood erect and was somewhat
boastful, but now that he has become full of the blessing
of the Lord he is humbled thereby, and bows himself
down; he is waiting for the sickle, and he dreads it
not, for no common reaper shall come to gather Christ's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
people&mdash;he himself shall reap the harvest of the world.
The Lord leaves the destroying angel to reap the vintage
and to cast it into the wine-vat to be trodden with
vengeance; but as for the grain which he himself has
sown, he will gather it himself with his own golden sickle.
We are looking for this. We are growing among the
tares, and sometimes we are half afraid lest the tares
should be stronger than ourselves and choke the wheat;
but we shall be separated by-and-by, and when the corn
is well winnowed and stored in the garner, we shall be
there. It is this expectation which even now makes our
hearts throb with joy. We have gone to the grave with
precious sheaves that belonged to our Master, and when
we were there we thought we could almost say, "Lord,
if they sleep they shall do well. Let us die with them."
Our joy of harvest is the hope of being at rest with all
the saints, and for ever with the Lord. A view of these
shadowy harvests upon earth should make us exceedingly
glad, because they are the image and foreshadowing
of the eternal harvest above.</p>


<p class="p2">So much about the joy of harvest; but I hasten
onward. <span class="smcap">What joys are those which to the believer
are as the joy of harvest?</span> It is a common notion
that Christians are an unhappy people. It is true that
we are tried, but it is false that we are miserable. With
all their trials, believers have such a compensation in the
love of Christ that they are still a blessed generation,
and it may be said of them, "Happy art thou, O
Israel."</p>

<p>One of the first seasons in which we knew a joy
equal to the joy of harvest&mdash;a season which has continued
with us ever since it commenced&mdash;was <i>when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
found the Saviour</i>, and so obtained salvation. You recollect
for yourselves, brethren and sisters, the time of the
ploughing of your souls. My heart was fallow, and
covered with weeds; but on a certain day the great
Husbandman came and began to plough my soul. Ten
black horses were his team, and it was a sharp ploughshare
that he used, and the ploughers made deep
furrows. The ten commandments were those black
horses, and the justice of God, like a ploughshare, tore
my spirit. I was condemned, undone, destroyed, lost,
helpless, hopeless&mdash;I thought hell was before me. Then
there came a cross ploughing, for when I went to hear
the gospel it did not comfort me; it made me wish I had
a part in it, but I feared that such a boon was out of the
question. The choicest promises of God frowned at
me, and his threatenings thundered at me. I prayed,
but found no answer of peace. It was long with me
thus. After the ploughing came the sowing. God who
ploughed the heart made it conscious that it needed the
gospel, and the gospel seed was joyfully received. Do
you recollect that auspicious day when at last you began
to have some little hope? It was very little&mdash;like a
green blade that peeps up from the soil; you scarce
knew whether it was grass or corn, whether it was presumption
or true faith. It was a little hope, but it
grew very pleasantly. Alas, a frost of doubt came;
snow of fear fell; cold winds of despondency blew on
you, and you said, "There can be no hope for me."
But what a glorious day was that when at last the wheat
which God had sown ripened, and you could say,
"I have looked unto him and have been lightened; I
have laid my sins on Jesus, where God laid them of old,
and they are taken away, and I am saved." I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
well that day, and so no doubt do many of you. O
sirs! no husbandman ever shouted for joy as our heart
shouted when a precious Christ was ours, and we could
grasp him with full assurance of salvation in him.
Many days have passed since then, but the joy of it is
still fresh with us. And, blessed be God, it is not the
joy of the first day only that we look back upon; it is
the joy of every day since then, more or less; for our
joy no man taketh from us; still we are walking in
Christ, even as we received him. Even now all our hope
on him is stayed, all our help from him we bring; and
our joy and peace continue with us because they are
based upon an immovable foundation. We rejoice in the
Lord, yea, and we will rejoice.</p>

<p>The joy of harvest generally shows itself by the
farmer giving a feast to his friends and neighbors;
and, usually, those who find Christ express their joy by
telling their friends and their neighbors how great
things the Lord hath done for them. The grace of God
is communicative. A man cannot be saved, and always
hold his tongue about it; as well look for dumb choirs
in heaven as for a silent church on earth. If a man has
been thirsty, and has come to the living stream, his
first impulse will be to cry, "Ho! every one that
thirsteth!" Do you feel the joy of harvest, the joy
that makes you wish that others should share with
you? If so, do not repress the impulse to proclaim your
happiness. Speak of Christ to brothers and sisters, to
friends and kinsfolk; and, if the language be stammering,
the message in itself is so important that the
words in which you couch it will be a secondary consideration.
Tell it, tell it out far and wide&mdash;that there
is a Saviour, that you have found him, and that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
blood can wash away transgression. Tell it every where;
and so the joy of harvest shall spread o'er land and sea,
and God shall be glorified.</p>

<p>We have another joy which is like the joy of harvest.
We frequently have it, too. It is <i>the joy of
answered prayer</i>. I hope you know what it is to pray in
faith. Some prayer is not worth the words used in presenting
it, because there is no faith mixed with it.
"With all thy sacrifices thou shalt offer salt," and the
salt of faith is needful if we would have our sacrifices
accepted. Those who are familiar with the mercy-seat
know that prayer is a reality, and that the doctrine of
divine answers to prayer is no fiction. Sometimes God
will delay to answer for wise reasons; then his children
must cry, and cry, and cry again. They are in the condition
of the husbandman who must wait for the precious
fruits of the earth; and when at last the answer to
prayer comes, they are then in the husbandman's position
when he receives the harvest. Remember Hannah's
wail and Hannah's word. In the bitterness of her soul
she cried to God, and when her child was given to her
she called it "Samuel," meaning, "Asked of God;"
for, said she, "For this child I prayed." He was a
dear child to her, because he was a child of prayer.
Any mercy that comes to you in answer to prayer will
be your Samuel mercy, your darling mercy. You will
say of it, "For this mercy I prayed," and it will bring
the joy of harvest to your spirit. If the Lord desires to
surprise his children he has only to answer their prayers;
for the most of them would be astonished if an
answer came to their petitions. I know how they speak
about answers to prayer. They say, "How remarkable!
How wonderful!" as if it were anything re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>markable
that God should be true, and that the Most
High should keep his promise. Oh for more faith to
rest upon his word! and we should have more of these
harvest joys.</p>

<p>We have another joy of harvest in ourselves <i>when
we conquer a temptation</i>. We know what it is to get under
a cloud sometimes; sin within us rises with a darkening
force, or an external adversity beclouds us, and
we miss the plain path we were accustomed to walk in.
A child of God at such times will cry mightily for help;
for he is fearful of himself and fearful of his surroundings.
Some of God's people have been by the week and
month together exposed to the double temptation, from
without and from within, and have cried to God in
bitter anguish. It has been a very hard struggle; the
sinful action has been painted in very fascinating colors,
and the siren voice of temptation has almost enchanted
them. But when at last they have got through the
valley of the shadow of death without having slipped
with their feet; when, after all, they have not been destroyed
by Apollyon, but have come forth again into
the daylight, they feel a joy unspeakable, compared
with which the joy of harvest is mere childish merriment.
Those know deep joy who have felt bitter
sorrow. As the man feels that he is the stronger for the
conflict, as he feels that he has gathered experience and
stronger faith from having passed through the trial, he
lifts up his heart, and rejoices, not in himself, but before
his God, with the joy of harvest. Brethren beloved,
you know what that means.</p>

<p>Again, there is such a thing as the joy of harvest
<i>when we have been rendered useful</i>. The master passion of
every Christian is to be useful. There should be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
burning zeal within us for the glory of God. When the
man who desires to be useful has laid his plans and set
about his work, he begins to look out for the results;
but perhaps it will be weeks, or years, before results
will come. The worker is not to be blamed that there
are no fruits as yet, but he is to be blamed if he is content
to be without fruits. A preacher may preach without
conversions, and who shall blame him? but if he be
happy, who shall excuse him? It is ours to break our
own hearts if we cannot by God's grace break other
men's hearts, if others will not weep for their sins it
should be our constant habit to weep for them. When
the heart becomes earnest, warm, zealous, God usually
gives a measure of success, some fiftyfold, some a hundredfold.
When the success comes it is the joy of
harvest indeed. I cannot help being egotistical enough
to mention the joy I felt when first I heard that a soul
had found peace through my youthful ministry. I had
been preaching in a village some few Sabbaths with an
increasing congregation, but I had not heard of a conversion,
and I thought, "Perhaps I am not called of
God. He does not mean me to preach, for if he did he
would give me spiritual children." One Sabbath my
good deacon said, "Don't be discouraged. A poor
woman was savingly impressed last Sabbath." How
long do you suppose it was before I saw that woman?
It was just as long as it took me to reach her cottage.
I was eager to hear from her own lips whether it was a
work of God's grace or not. I always looked upon her
with interest, though only a poor laborer's wife, till she
was taken away to heaven, after having lived a holy
life. Many since then have I rejoiced over in the Lord,
but that first seal to my ministry was peculiarly dear to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
me. It gave me a sip of the joy of harvest. If somebody
had left me a fortune it would not have caused me
one-hundredth part of the delight I had in discovering
that a soul had been led to the Saviour. I am sure
Christian people who have not this joy have missed one
of the choicest delights that a believer can know this
side heaven. In fact, when I see souls saved, I do
not envy Gabriel his throne nor the angels their harps.
It shall be our heaven to be out of heaven for a season if
we can but bring others to know the Saviour and so add
fresh jewels to the Redeemer's crown.</p>

<p>I will mention another delight which is as the joy
of harvest, and that is <i>fellowship with the Lord Jesus
Christ</i>. This is not so much a matter for speech as for
experience and delight. If we try to speak of what
communion with Christ is, we fail. Solomon, the wisest
of men, when inspired to write of the fellowship of
the church with her Lord, was compelled to write in
allegories and emblems, and though to the spiritual
mind the Book of Canticles is always delightful, yet to
the carnal mind it seems a mere love song. The natural
man discerneth not the things that be of God, for
they are spiritual, and can only be spiritually discerned.
But, oh, the bliss of knowing that Christ is yours, and
of entering into nearness of communion with him. To
thrust your hand into his side, and your finger into the
print of the nails; these be not everyday joys; but
when such near and dear communings come to us on
our highdays and holydays, they make our souls like
the chariots of Ammi-nadib, or, if you will, they cause
us to tread the world beneath our feet and all that earth
calls good or great. Our condition matters nothing to
us if Christ be with us&mdash;he is our God, our comfort,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and our all, and we rejoice before him as with the joy
of harvest.</p>


<p class="p2">I have no time to enlarge further; for I want to
close with one other practical word. Many of us are
anxiously desiring a harvest which would bring to us an
intense delight. Of late, divers persons have communicated
to me in many ways the strong emotion they feel
of pity for the souls of men. Others of us have felt a
mysterious impulse to pray more than we did, and to be
more anxious than ever we were that Christ would save
poor perishing sinners. We shall not be satisfied until
there is a thorough awakening in this land. We did
not raise the feeling in our own minds, and we do not
desire to repress it. We do not believe it can be repressed;
but others will feel the same heavenly affection,
and will sigh and cry to God day and night until
the blessing comes. This is the sowing, this is the
ploughing, this is the harrowing&mdash;may it go on to harvesting.
I long to hear my brethren and sisters universally
saying, "We are full of anguish, we are in
agony till souls be saved." The cry of Rachel, "Give
me children, or I die," is the cry of your minister this
day, and the longing of thousands more besides. As
that desire grows in intensity a revival is approaching.
We must have spiritual children born to Christ, or our
hearts will break for the longing that we have for their
salvation. Oh for more of these longings, yearnings,
cravings, travailings! If we plead till the harvest of
revival comes we shall partake in the joy of it.</p>

<p>Who will have the most joy? Those who have been
the most concerned about it. You who do not pray in
private, nor come out to prayer-meetings, will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
have the joy when the blessing comes, and the church is
increased. You had no share in the sowing, therefore
you will have little share in the reaping. You who
never speak to others about their souls, who take no
share in Sunday-school or mission work, but simply eat
the fat and drink the sweet&mdash;you shall have none of the
joy of harvest, for you do not put your hands to the
work of the Lord. And who would wish that idlers
should be happy? Rather in our zeal and jealousy we
feel inclined to say, "Curse ye Meroz, curse ye bitterly
the inhabitants thereof; because they came not up to
the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against
the mighty." If you come to the help of the Lord by
his own divine Spirit, you shall share the joy of harvest.
Perhaps none will have more of that joy than those who
shall have the privilege of seeing their own dear ones
brought to God. Some of you have children who are a
trial to you whenever you think of them; let them be
such a trial to you that they drive you to incessant
prayer for them, and, if the blessing comes, why should
it not drop on them? If a revival comes, why should
not your daughter yet be converted, and that wild boy
of yours be brought in, or even your gray-headed
father, who has been sceptical and unbelieving&mdash;why
should not the grace of God come to him? And, oh,
what a joy of harvest you will have then? What bliss
will thrill through your spirit when you see those who
are united to you in ties of blood united to Christ your
Lord! Pray much for them with earnest faith, and you
shall yet have the joy of harvest in your own house, a
shout of harvest home in your own family.</p>

<p>Possibly, my hearer, you have not much to do with
such joy, for you are yourself unsaved. Yet it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
grand thing for an unconverted person to be under a
ministry that God blesses, and with a people that pray
for conversions. It is a happy thing for you, young man,
to have a Christian mother. It is a great boon for you,
O unconverted woman, that you have a godly sister.
These make us hopeful for you. While your relations
are prayerful, we are hopeful for <i>you</i>. May the Lord
Jesus be yours yet. But, oh! if you remain unbelieving,
however rich a blessing comes to others, it
will leave <i>you</i> none the better for it. "If ye be willing
and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land;" but
there are some who may cry in piteous accents, "The
harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not
saved." It has been remarked that those who pass
through a season of revival and remain unconverted are
more hardened and unimpressed than before. I believe
it to be so, and I therefore pray the divine Spirit to come
with such energy that none of you may escape his
power. May you be led to pray,</p>

<p>Oh for earnest, importunate prayer from all believers
throughout the world! If our churches could be stirred
up to incessant, vehement crying to God, so as to give
him no rest till he make Zion a praise in the earth, we
might expect to see God's kingdom come and the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of Satan fall. As many of you as love Christ, I charge
you by his dear name to be much in prayer; as many
of you as love the Church of God, and desire her prosperity,
I beseech you keep not back in this time of supplication.
The Lord grant that you may be led to
plead till the harvest joy is granted. Do you remember
one Sabbath my saying, "The Lord deal so with you as
you deal with his work during this next month." I
feel as if it will be so with many of you&mdash;that the Lord
will deal so with you as you shall deal with his Church.
If you scatter little you shall have little, if you pray little
you shall have little favor; but if you have zeal and
faith, and plead much and work much for the Lord,
good measure, pressed down and running over, shall
the Lord return into your own bosoms. If you water
others with drops you shall receive drops in return;
but if the Spirit helps you to pour out rivers of living
water from your own soul, then floods of heavenly grace
shall flow into your spirit. God bring in the unconverted,
and lead them to a simple trust in Jesus; then
shall they also know the joy of harvest. We ask it for
his name's sake. Amen.</p>

<p class="small">"Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ruth</span> 2:15.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Country</span> friends need no explanation of what is
meant by gleaning. I hope the custom will never be
banished from the land, but that the poor will always
be allowed their little share of the harvest. I am afraid
that many who see gleaning every year in the fields of
their own parish are not yet wise enough to understand
the heavenly art of spiritual gleaning. That is the subject
which I have chosen on this occasion, and my text
is taken from the charming story of Ruth, which is
known to every one of you. I shall use the story as setting
forth our own case, in a homely but instructive
way. In the first place, we shall observe that there is <i>a
great Husbandman</i>; it was Boaz in Ruth's case, it is our
heavenly Father who is the Husbandman in our case.
Secondly, we shall notice <i>a humble gleaner</i>; the gleaner
was Ruth in this instance, but she may be looked upon
as the representative of every believer. And, in the
third place, here is a <i>gracious permission given</i> to Ruth:
"Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach
her not," and the same permission is spiritually given
to us.</p>


<p class="p2">I. In the first place, the God of the whole earth is
<span class="smcap">a great Husbandman</span>. This is true in <i>natural</i> things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
As a matter of fact all farm operations are carried on by
his power and prudence. Man may plough the soil, and
sow the seed; but as Jesus said, "My Father is the husbandman."
He appoints the clouds and allots the sunshine;
he directs the winds and distributes the dew and
the rain; he also gives the frost and the heat, and so
by various processes of nature he brings forth food for
man and beast. All the farming, however, which God
does, is for the benefit of others, and never for himself.
He has no need of any of our works of husbandry. If
he were hungry, he would not tell us. "The cattle on
a thousand hills," says he, "are mine." The purest
kindness and benevolence are those which dwell in the
heart of God. Though all things are God's, his works
in creation and in providence are not for himself, but
for his creatures. This should greatly encourage us in
trusting to him.</p>

<p>In <i>spiritual</i> matters God is a great husbandman;
and there, too, all his works are done for his children,
that they may be fed upon the finest of the wheat. Permit
me to speak of the wide gospel fields which our
heavenly Father farms for the good of his children.
There is a great variety of these fields, and they are all
fruitful; for "the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a
land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop
down dew." Deut. 33:28. Every field which our
heavenly Father tills yields a plentiful harvest, for there
are no failures or famines with him.</p>

<p>1. One part of his farm is called <i>Doctrine field</i>.
What full sheaves of finest wheat are to be found there!
He who is permitted to glean in it will gather bread
enough and to spare, for the land brings forth by handfuls.
Look at that goodly sheaf of election; full, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of heavy ears of corn, such as Pharaoh saw in his first
dream&mdash;ears full and strong. There is the great sheaf
of final perseverance, where each ear is a promise that
the work which God has begun he will assuredly complete.
If we have not faith enough to partake of either
of these sheaves, we may glean around the choice
sheaves of redemption by the blood of Christ. Many a
poor soul who could not feed on electing love, nor realize
his perseverance in Christ, can yet feed on the
atonement and rejoice in the sublime doctrine of substitution.
Many and rich are the sheaves which stand thick
together in Doctrine field; these, when threshed by
meditation and ground in the mill of thought, furnish
royal food for the Lord's family.</p>

<p>I wonder why it is that some of our Master's stewards
are so prone to lock the gate of this field, as if they
thought it dangerous ground. For my part, I wish my
people not only to glean here, but to carry home the
sheaves by the wagon-load, for they cannot be too well
fed when truth is the food. Are my fellow-laborers
afraid that Jeshurun will wax fat and kick, if he has too
much food? I fear there is more likelihood of his dying
of starvation if the bread of sound doctrine is withheld.
If we have a love to the precepts and warnings of the
word, we need not be afraid of the doctrines; on the
contrary, we should search them out and feed upon them
with joy. The doctrines of distinguishing grace are to
be set forth in due proportions to the rest of the word,
and those are poor pulpits from which these grand
truths are excluded. We must not keep the Lord's
people out of this field. I say, swing the gate open,
and come in, all of you who are children of God! I am
sure that in my Master's field nothing grows which will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
harm you. Gospel doctrine is always safe doctrine.
You may feast upon it till you are full, and no harm will
come of it. Be afraid of no revealed truth. Be afraid
of spiritual ignorance, but not of holy knowledge.
Grow in grace and in the knowledge of your Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ. Everything taught in the word
of God is meant to be the subject of a Christian's study,
therefore neglect nothing. Visit the doctrine field
daily, and glean in it with the utmost diligence.</p>

<p>2. The great Husbandman has another field called
<i>Promise field</i>; of that I shall not need to speak, for I
hope you often enter it and glean from it. Just let us
take an ear or two out of one of the sheaves, and show
them to you that you may be induced to stay there the
live-long day, and carry home a rich load at night.
Here is an ear: "The mountains shall depart, and the
hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from
thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed."
Here is another: "When thou passest
through the waters, I will be with thee; and through
the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou
walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned;
neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." Here is
another; it has a short stalk, but a heavy ear: "My
strength is sufficient for thee." Another is long in the
straw, but very rich in corn: "Let not your heart be
troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my
Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so I
would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you;
and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come
again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am,
there ye may be also." What a word is that!&mdash;"I will
come again." Yes, beloved, we can say of the Promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
field what cannot be said of a single acre in all England;
namely, that it is so rich a field that it could not
be richer, and that it has so many ears of corn in it that
you could not insert another. As the poet sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"What more can he say, than to you he hath said,&mdash;</div>
<div class="line small ip5">You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?"</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>Glean in that field, O ye poor and needy ones, and
never think that you are intruding. The whole field is
your own, every ear of it; you may draw out from the
sheaves themselves, and the more you take the more
you may.</p>

<p>3. Then there is <i>Ordinance field</i>; a great deal of
good wheat grows in this field. The field of Baptism
has been exceedingly fruitful to some of us, for it has
set forth to us our death, burial, and resurrection in
Christ, and thus we have been cheered and instructed.
It has been good for us to declare ourselves on the
Lord's side, and we have found that in keeping our
Lord's commandments there is great reward. But I
will not detain you long in this field, for some of our
friends think it has a damp soil: I wish them more light
and more grace. However, we will pass on to the field
of the Supper, where grows the very best of our Lord's
corn. What rich things have we fed upon in this choice
spot! Have we not there tasted the sweetest and most
sustaining of all spiritual food? In all the estate no field
is to be found to rival this centre and crown of all the
domain; this is the King's Acre. Gospel gleaner, abide
in that field; glean in it on the first day of every week,
and expect to see your Lord there; for it is written,
"He was known of them in the breaking of bread."</p>

<p>4. The heavenly Husbandman has one field upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
a hill, which equals the best of the others, even if it
does not excel them. You cannot really and truly go
into any of the other fields unless you pass into this;
for the road to the other fields lies through this hill
farm; it is called <i>Fellowship and Communion with Christ</i>.
This is the field for the Lord's choicest ones to glean in.
Some of you have only run through it, you have not
stopped long enough in it; but he who knows how to
stay here, yea, to live here, shall spend his hours most
profitably and pleasantly. It is only in proportion as
we hold fellowship with Christ, and communion with
him, that either ordinances, or doctrines, or promises
can profit us. All other things are dry and barren unless
we are enjoying the love of Christ, unless we bear
his likeness, unless we dwell continually with him, and
rejoice in his love. I am sorry to say that few Christians
think much of this field; it is enough for them to
be sound in doctrine, and tolerably correct in practice;
they care far less than they should about intimate inter
course with Christ Jesus, their Lord, by the Holy
Ghost. I am sure that if we gleaned in this field we
should not have half so many naughty tempers nor a
tenth as much pride, nor a hundredth part so much
sloth. This is a field hedged and sheltered, and in it
you will find better food than that which angels feed
upon; yea, you will find Jesus himself as the bread
which came down from heaven. Blessed, blessed field,
may we visit it every day. The Master leaves the gate
wide open for every believer; let us enter in and
gather the golden ears till we can carry no more. Thus
we have seen the great Husbandman in his fields; let
us rejoice that we have such a great Husbandman near,
and such fields to glean in.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">II. And now, in the second place, we have <span class="smcap">a
humble gleaner</span>. Ruth was a gleaner, and may serve
as an illustration of what every believer should be in
the fields of God.</p>

<p>1. The believer is a favored gleaner, for he <i>may take
home a whole sheaf if he likes</i>; he may bear away all that
he can possibly carry, for all things are freely given him
of the Lord. I use the figure of a gleaner because I believe
that few Christians ever go much beyond it, and
yet they are free to do so if they are able. Some may
say, Why does not the believer reap all the field, and
take all the corn home with him? I answer that he is
welcome to do so if he can; for no good thing will the
Lord withhold from them that walk uprightly. If your
faith is like a great wagon, and you can carry the
whole field of corn, you have full permission to take it.
Alas, our faith is so little that we rather glean than
reap; we are straitened in ourselves, not in our God.
May you all outgrow the metaphor, and come home,
bringing your sheaves with you.</p>

<p>2. Again, we may remark, that the gleaner in her
business <i>has to endure much toil and fatigue</i>. She rises
early in the morning, and she trudges off to a field; if
that be closed, she hastens to another; and if that be
shut up, or gleaned already, she hurries farther still;
and all day long, while the sun is shining upon her, she
seldom sits down to refresh herself, but still she goes
on, stoop, stoop, stoop, gathering the ears one by one.
She returns not to her home till nightfall; for she desires,
if the field is good, to do much business that day,
and she will not go home until she is loaded down. Beloved,
so let each one of us do when we seek spiritual
food. Let us not be afraid of a little fatigue in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Master's fields; if the gleaning is good, we must not
soon weary in gathering the precious spoil, for the
gains will richly reward our pains. I know a friend
who walks five miles every Sunday to hear the gospel,
and has the same distance to return. Another thinks
little of a ten miles' journey; and these are wise, for to
hear the pure word of God no labor is extravagant. To
stand in the aisle till ready to drop, listening all the
while with strained attention, is a toil which meets a
full reward if the gospel be heard and the Spirit of God
bless it to the soul. A gleaner does not expect that the
ears will come to her of themselves; she knows that
gleaning is hard work. We must not expect to find the
best field next to our own house, we may have to journey
to the far end of the parish, but what of that?
Gleaners must not be choosers, and where the Lord
sends the gospel, there he calls us to be present.</p>

<p>3. We remark, next, that <i>every ear the gleaner gets she
has to stoop for</i>. Why is it that proud people seldom
profit under the word? Why is it that certain "intellectual"
folk cannot get any good out of our soundest
ministers? Why, because they must needs have the
corn lifted up for them; and if the wheat is held so high
over their heads that they can hardly see it, they are
pleased, and cry, "Here is something wonderful."
They admire the extraordinary ability of the man who
can hold up the truth so high that nobody can reach it;
but truly that is a sorry feat. The preacher's business
is to place truth within the reach of all, children as
well as adults; he is to let fall handfuls on purpose for
poor gleaners, and these will never mind stooping to
collect the ears. If we preach to the educated people
only, the wise ones can understand, but the illiterate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
cannot; but when we preach in all simplicity to the
poor, other classes can understand it if they like, and if
they do not like, they had better go somewhere else.
Those who cannot stoop to pick up plain truth had
better give up gleaning. For my part, I would be
taught by a child if I could thereby know and understand
the gospel better: the gleaning in our Lord's field
is so rich that it is worth the hardest labor to be able to
carry home a portion of it. Hungry souls know this,
and are not to be hindered in seeking their heavenly
food. We will go down on our knees in prayer, and
stoop by self-humiliation, and confession of ignorance,
and so gather with the hand of faith the daily bread of
our hungering souls.</p>

<p>4. Note, in the next place, that what a gleaner gets
<i>she wins ear by ear</i>; occasionally she picks up a handful
at once, but as a rule it is straw by straw. In the case
of Ruth, handfuls were let fall on purpose for her; but
she was highly favored. The gleaner stoops, and gets
one ear, and then she stoops again for another. Now,
beloved, where there are handfuls to be got at once,
there is the place to go and glean; but if you cannot
meet with such abundance, be glad to gather ear by
ear. I have heard of certain persons who have been in
the habit of hearing a favorite minister, and when they
go to another place, they say, "I cannot hear anybody
after my own minister; I shall stay at home and read
a sermon." Please remember the passage, "Not forsaking
the assembling of yourselves together, as the
manner of some is." Let me also entreat you not to
be so foolishly partial as to deprive your soul of its food.
If you cannot get a handful at one stoop, do not refuse
to gather an ear at a time. If you are not content to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
learn here a little and there a little, you will soon be
half starved, and then you will be glad to get back
again to the despised minister and pick up what his field
will yield you. That is a sorry ministry which yields
nothing. Go and glean where the Lord has opened the
gate for you. Why the text alone is worth the journey;
do not miss it.</p>

<p>5. Note, next, that <i>what the gleaner picks up she keeps
in her hand</i>; she does not drop the corn as fast as she
gathers it. There is a good thought at the beginning
of the sermon, but the hearers are so eager to hear
another, that the first one slips away. Toward the
end of the sermon a large handful falls in their way,
and they forget all that went before in their eagerness
to retain this last and richest portion. The sermon is
over, and, alas, it is nearly all gone from the memory,
for many are about as wise as a gleaner would be if she
should pick up one ear, and drop it; pick up another,
and drop it, and so on all day. The net result of such
a day's work in a stubble is a bad backache; and I
fear that all our hearers will get by their hearing will
be a headache. Be attentive, but be retentive too.
Gather the grain and tie it up in bundles for carrying
away with you, and mind you do not lose it on the road
home. Many a person when he has got a fair hold of
the sermon, loses it on the way to his house by idle talk
with vain companions. I have heard of a Christian
man who was seen hurrying home one Sunday with all
his might. A friend asked him why he was in such
haste. "Oh!" said he, "two or three Sundays ago,
our minister gave us a most blessed discourse, and I
greatly enjoyed it; but when I got outside, there were
two deacons discussing, and one pulled the sermon one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
way, and the other the other, till they pulled it all to
pieces, and I lost all the savor of it." Those must have
been very bad deacons; let us not imitate them; and if
we know of any who are of their school, let us walk
home alone in dogged silence sooner than lose all our
gleanings by their controversies. After a good sermon
go home with your ears and your mouth shut. Act
like the miser, who not only gets all he can, but keeps
all he can. Do not lose by trifling talk that which may
make you rich to all eternity.</p>

<p>6. Then, again, the gleaner <i>takes the wheat home and
threshes it</i>. It is a wise thing to thresh a sermon, whoever
may have been the preacher, for it is certain that
there is a portion of straw and chaff about it. Many
thresh the preacher by finding needless fault; but that
is not half so good as threshing the sermon to get out
of it the pure truth. Take a sermon, beloved, when
you get one which is worth having, and lay it down on
the floor of meditation, and beat it out with the flail of
prayer, and you will get bread-corn from it. This threshing
by prayer and meditation must never be neglected.
If a gleaner should stow away her corn in her room, and
leave it there, the mice would get at it; but she would
have no food from it if she did not thresh out the grain.
Some get a sermon, and carry it home, and allow Satan
and sin, and the world, to eat it all up, and it becomes
unfruitful and worthless to them. But he who knows
how to flail a sermon well, so as to clear out all the
wheat from the straw, he is it that makes a good hearer
and feeds his soul on what he hears.</p>

<p>7. And then, in the last place, the good woman,
after threshing the corn, no doubt <i>winnowed it</i>. Ruth
did all this in the field; but you can scarcely do so.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
You must do some of the work at home. And observe,
she did not take the chaff home; she left that behind
her in the field. It is a prudent thing to winnow all
the discourses you hear so as to separate the precious
from the vile; but pray do not fall into the silly habit
of taking home all the chaff, and leaving the corn behind.
I think I hear you say, "I shall recollect that
queer expression; I shall make an anecdote out of that
odd remark." Listen, then, for I have a word for you&mdash;if
you hear a man retail nothing about a minister except
his oddities, just stop him, and say, "We have all
our faults, and perhaps those who are most ready to
speak of those of others are not quite perfect themselves:
cannot you tell us what the preacher said that
was worth hearing?" In many cases the virtual
answer will be, "Oh, I don't recollect that." They
have sifted the corn, thrown away the good grain, and
brought home the chaff. Ought they not to be put in
an asylum? Follow the opposite rule; drop the straw,
and retain the good corn. Separate between the precious
and the vile, and let the worthless material go
where it may; you have no use for it, and the sooner
you are rid of it the better. Judge with care; reject
false teaching with decision, and retain true doctrine
with earnestness, so shall you practise the enriching art
of heavenly gleaning. May the Lord teach us wisdom,
so that we may become "rich to all the intents of
bliss;" so shall our mouth be satisfied with good
things, and our youth shall be renewed like the eagle's.</p>


<p class="p2">III. And now, in the last place, here is <span class="smcap">a gracious
permission given</span>: "Let her glean among the sheaves,
and reproach her not." Ruth had no right to go among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the sheaves till Boaz gave her permission by saying,
"Let her do it." For her to be allowed to go among
the sheaves, in that part of the field where the wheat
was newly cut, and none of it carted, was a great favor:
but Boaz whispered that handfuls were to be dropped
on purpose for her, and that was a greater favor still.
Boaz had a secret love for the maiden, and even so,
beloved, it is because of our Lord's eternal love to us
that he allows us to enter his best fields and glean
among the sheaves. His grace permits us to lay hold
upon doctrinal blessings, promise blessings, and experience
blessings: the Lord has a favor toward us,
and hence these singular kindnesses. We have no right
to any heavenly blessings of ourselves; our portion is
due to free and sovereign grace.</p>

<p>I tell you the reasons that moved Boaz's heart to
let Ruth go among the sheaves. The master motive
was <i>because he loved her</i>. He would have her go there,
because he had conceived an affection for her, which he
afterward displayed in grander ways. So the Lord lets
his people come and glean among the sheaves, because
he loves them. Didst thou have a soul-enriching season
among the sheaves the other Sabbath? Didst thou
carry home thy sack, filled like those of Joseph's
brothers, when they returned from Egypt? Didst thou
have an abundance? Wast thou satisfied? Mark;
that was thy Master's goodness. It was because he
loved thee. Look, I beseech thee, on all thy spiritual
enjoyments as proof of his eternal love. Look on all
heavenly blessings as being tokens of heavenly grace.
It will make thy corn grind all the better, and eat all
the sweeter, if thou wilt reflect that eternal love gave it
thee. Thy sweet seasons, thy high enjoyments, thy un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>speakable
ravishments of spirit are all proofs of divine
affection, therefore be doubly glad of them.</p>

<p>There was another reason why Boaz allows Ruth to
glean among the sheaves; it was because he was her
<i>relative</i>. This is why our Lord gives us choice favors
at times, and takes us into his banqueting-house in so
gracious a manner. He is our next of kin, bone of our
bone, and flesh of our flesh. Our Redeemer, our kinsman,
is the Lord Jesus, and he will never be strange to
his own flesh. It is a high and charming mystery that
our Lord Jesus is the Husband of his church; and sure
he may well let his spouse glean among the sheaves;
for all that he possesses is hers already. Her interests
and his interests are one, and so he may well say,
"Beloved, take all thou pleasest; I am none the poorer
because thou dost partake of my fulness, for thou art
mine. Thou art my partner, and my choice, and all
that I have is thine." What, then, shall I say to you
who are my Lord's beloved? How shall I speak with a
tenderness and generosity equal to his desires, for he
would have me speak right lovingly in his name. Enrich
yourselves out of that which is your Lord's. Go
a spiritual gleaning as often as ever you can. Never
lose an opportunity of picking up a golden blessing.
Glean at the mercy-seat; glean in private meditation;
glean in reading pious books; glean in associating with
godly men; glean everywhere; and if you can get only
a little handful it will be better than none. You who
are so much in business, and so much penned up by
cares; if you can only spend five minutes in the Lord's
field gleaning a little, be sure to do so. If you cannot
bear away a sheaf, carry an ear; and if you cannot
find an ear, pick up even a grain of wheat. Take care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to get a little, if you cannot get much: but gather as
much as ever you can.</p>

<p>Just one other remark. O child of God, never be
afraid to glean. Have faith in God, and take the
promises home to yourself. Jesus will rejoice to see
you making free with his good things. His voice is
"Eat abundantly; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved."
Therefore, if you find a rich promise, live
upon it. Draw the honey out of the comb of Scripture,
and live on its sweetness. If you meet with a most extraordinary
sheaf, carry it away rejoicing. You cannot
believe too much concerning your Lord; let not Satan
cheat you into contentment with a meagre portion of
grace when all the granaries of heaven are open to
you. Glean on with humble industry and hopeful confidence,
and know that he who owns both fields and
sheaves is looking upon you with eyes of love, and will
one day espouse you to himself in glory everlasting.
Happy gleaner who finds eternal love and eternal life
in the fields in which he gleans!</p>

<p class="small">"And Boaz said unto her, At meal-time come thou hither, and eat of the

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">We</span> are going to the cornfields, not so much to
glean, as to rest with the reapers and gleaners, when

confidence enough to dip <i>her</i> morsel in the vinegar.

own account, and kindness enough to carry home a
portion to our needy friends at home.</p>


<p class="p2">I. Our first point of remark is this&mdash;<span class="smcap">that God's
reapers have their meal-times</span>.</p>

<p>Those who work for God will find him a good
master. He cares for oxen, and he has commanded
Israel, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth
out the corn." Much more doth he care for his servants
who serve him. "He hath given meat unto them
that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant."
The reapers in Jesus' fields shall not only receive
a blessed reward at the last, but they shall have
plenteous comforts by the way. He is pleased to pay
his servants twice; first in the labor itself, and a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
time in the labor's sweet results. He gives them such
joy and consolation in the service of their Master that
it is a sweet employ, and they cry, "We delight to do
thy will, O Lord." Heaven is made up of serving God
day and night, and a foretaste of heaven is enjoyed in
serving God on earth with earnest perseverance.</p>

<p>God has ordained certain meal-times for his reapers;
and he has appointed that one of these shall be
<i>when they come together to listen to the Word preached</i>. If
God be with ministers they act as the disciples did of
old, for they received the loaves and the fishes from the
Lord Jesus, and then they handed them to the people.
<i>We</i>, of ourselves, cannot feed one soul, much less thousands;
but when the Lord is with us we can keep as
good a table as Solomon himself, with all his fine flour,
and fat oxen, and roebucks, and fallow-deer. When the
Lord blesses the provisions of his House, no matter
how many thousands there may be, all his poor shall be
filled with bread. I hope, beloved, you know what it is
to sit under the shadow of the Word with great delight,
and find the fruit thereof sweet unto your taste. Where
the doctrines of grace are boldly and plainly delivered
to you in connection with the other truths of revelation;
where Jesus Christ upon his cross is always lifted up;
where the work of the Spirit is not forgotten; where the
glorious purpose of the Father is never despised, there
is sure to be rich provision for the children of God.</p>

<p>Often, too, our gracious Lord appoints us meal-times
<i>in our private readings and meditations</i>. Here it is
that his "paths drop fatness." Nothing can be more
fattening to the soul of the believer than feeding upon
the Word, and digesting it by frequent meditation.
No wonder that men grow so slowly when they meditate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
so little. Cattle must chew the cud; it is not that
which they crop with their teeth, but that which is
masticated, and digested by rumination, that nourishes
them. We must take the truth, and turn it over and
over again in the inward parts of our spirit, and so
shall we extract suitable nourishment therefrom. My
brethren, is not meditation the land of Goshen to you?
If men once said, "There is corn in Egypt," may
they not always say that the finest of the wheat is to be
found in secret prayer? Private devotion is a land
which floweth with milk and honey; a paradise yielding
all manner of fruits; a banqueting house of choice
wines. Ahasuerus might make a great feast, but all his
hundred and twenty provinces could not furnish such
dainties as meditation offers to the spiritual mind.
Where can we feed and lie down in green pastures in so
sweet a sense as we do in our musings on the Word?
Meditation distils the quintessence of joy from the
Scriptures, and gladdens our mouth with a sweetness
which excels the virgin honey. Your retired periods
and occasions of prayer should be to you refreshing seasons,
in which, like the reapers at noonday, you sit with
the Master and enjoy his generous provisions. The
Shepherd of Salisbury Plain was wont to say that when
he was lonely, and his wallet was empty, his Bible was
to him meat and drink, and company too; he is not the
only man who has found a fulness in the Word when all
else has been empty. During the battle of Waterloo a
godly soldier, mortally wounded, was carried by his
comrade into the rear, and being placed with his back
propped up against a tree, he besought his friend to
open his knapsack and take out the Bible which he had
carried in it. "Read to me," he said, "one verse be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>fore
I close my eyes in death." His comrade read him
that verse: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you;"
and there, fresh from the whistling of the bullets, and
the roll of the drum, and the tempest of human conflict,
that believing spirit enjoyed such holy calm that ere he
fell asleep in the arms of Jesus he said, "Yes, I have a
peace with God which passeth all understanding, which
keeps my heart and mind through Jesus Christ." Saints
most surely enjoy delightful meal-times when they are
alone in meditation.</p>

<p>Let us not forget that there is one specially ordained
meal-time which ought to occur at least once in the
week&mdash;I mean <i>the Supper of the Lord</i>. There you have
literally, as well as spiritually, a meal. The table is
richly spread, it has upon it both bread and wine; and
looking at what these symbolize, we have before us a
table richer than that which kings could furnish. There
we have the flesh and the blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ, whereof if a man eat he shall never hunger and
never thirst, for that bread shall be unto him everlasting
life. Oh! the sweet seasons we have known at the
Lord's Supper. If some of you knew the enjoyment of
feeding upon Christ in that ordinance you would chide
yourselves for not having united with the Church in
fellowship. In keeping the Master's commandments
there is "great reward," and consequently in neglecting
them there is great loss of reward. Christ is not
so tied to the sacramental table as to be always found
of those who partake thereat, but still it is "in the way"
that we may expect the Lord to meet with us. "If ye
love me, keep my commandments," is a sentence of
touching power. Sitting at this table, our soul has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
mounted up from the emblem to the reality; we have
eaten bread in the kingdom of God, and have leaned
our head upon Jesus' bosom. "He brought me to the
banqueting-house, and his banner over me was love."</p>

<p>Besides these regular meal-times, there are others
which God gives us, <i>at seasons when, perhaps, we little expect
them</i>. You have been walking the street, and suddenly
you have felt a holy flowing out of your soul toward
God; or in the middle of business your heart has
been melted with love and made to dance for joy, even
as the brooks, which have been bound with winter's ice,
leap to feel the touch of spring. You have been groaning,
dull, and earth-bound; but the sweet love of Jesus
has enwrapped your heart when you scarce thought of
it, and your spirit, all free, and all on fire, has rejoiced
before the Lord with timbrel and dance, like Miriam of
old. I have had times occasionally in preaching when
I would fain have kept on far beyond the appointed
hour, for my overflowing soul has been like a vessel
wanting vent. Seasons, too, we have had on our sick
beds, when we would have been content to be sick always
if we could have had our bed so well made by
tender love, and our head so softly pillowed on condescending
grace.</p>

<p>Our blessed Redeemer comes to us in the morning,
and wakes us up by dropping sweet thoughts upon our
souls; we know not how they came, but it is as if, when
the dew was visiting the flowers, a few drops had taken
pity upon us. In the cool eventide, too, as we have
gone to our bed, our meditation of him has been sweet;
and, in the night watches, when we tossed to and fro,
and could not sleep, he has been pleased to become our
song in the night.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>God's reapers find it hard work to reap; but they
gain a blessed solace when in one way or another they
sit down and eat of their Master's rich provisions; then,
with renewed strength, they rise with sharpened sickle,
to reap again in the noontide heat.</p>

<p>Let me observe that, while these meal-times come we
know not exactly when, there are <i>certain seasons when we
may expect them</i>. The Eastern reapers generally sit
down under the shelter of a tree, or a booth, to take
refreshment during the heat of the day. And certain I
am that when trouble, affliction, persecution, and bereavement
become the most painful to us, it is then
that the Lord hands out to us the sweetest comforts.
We must work till the hot sun forces the sweat from
our faces, and then we may look for repose; we must
bear the burden and heat of the day before we can expect
to be invited to those choice meals which the Lord
prepares for true laborers. When thy day of trouble is
hottest, then the love of Jesus shall be sweetest.</p>

<p>Again, these meal-times frequently occur <i>before</i> a
trial. Elijah must be entertained beneath a juniper tree,
for he is to go a forty days' journey in the strength of
that meat. You may suspect some danger nigh when
your delights are overflowing. If you see a ship taking
in great quantities of provision, it is probably bound
for a distant port, and when God gives you extraordinary
seasons of communion with Jesus, you may look
for long leagues of tempestuous sea. Sweet cordials
prepare for stern conflicts.</p>

<p>Times of refreshing also occur <i>after</i> trouble or arduous
service. Christ was tempted of the devil, and <i>afterward</i>
angels came and ministered unto him. Jacob
wrestled with God, and afterward, at Mahanaim, hosts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of angels met him. Abraham fought with the kings,
and returned from their slaughter, and then it was that
Melchisedec refreshed him with bread and wine. After
conflict, content; after battle, banquet. When thou
hast waited on thy Lord, then thou shalt sit down, and
thy Master will gird himself and wait upon thee.</p>

<p>Let worldlings say what they will about the hardness
of religion, we do not find it so. We own that
reaping for Christ has its difficulties and troubles; but
still the bread which we eat is of heavenly sweetness,
and the wine which we drink is crushed from celestial
clusters:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"I would not change my bless'd estate</div>
<div class="line small ip5">For all the world calls good or great;</div>
<div class="line small ip5">And while my faith can keep her hold,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">I envy not the sinner's gold."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="p2">II. Follow me while we turn to a second point.
<span class="smcap">To these meals the gleaner is affectionately invited.</span>
That is to say, the poor, trembling stranger who has
not strength enough to reap, who has no right to be in
the field except the right of charity the poor, trembling
sinner, conscious of his own demerit, and feeling
but little hope and little joy, is invited to the feast
of love.</p>

<p>In the text <i>the gleaner is invited to come</i>. "At meal-time
<i>come</i> thou hither." We trust none of you will be
kept away from the place of holy feasting by any shame
on account of your dress, or your personal character, or
your poverty; nay, nor even on account of your physical
infirmities. "At meal-time come thou hither." I
knew a deaf woman who could never hear a sound, and
yet she was always in the House of God, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
asked why, her reply was that a friend found her the
text, and then God was pleased to give her many a sweet
thought upon it while she sat with his people; besides,
she felt that as a believer she ought to honor God by
her <i>presence</i> in his courts, and by confessing her union
with his people; and, better still, she always liked to
be in the best of company, and as the presence of God
was there, and the holy angels, and the saints of the
Most High, whether she could hear or no, she would
go. If <i>such</i> persons find pleasure in coming, we who <i>can</i>
hear should never stay away. Though we feel our unworthiness,
we ought to be desirous to be laid in the
House of God, as the sick were at the pool of Bethesda,
hoping that the waters may be stirred, and that we may
step in and be healed. Trembling soul, never let the
temptations of the devil keep thee from the assembly of
worshippers; "at meal-time come thou hither."</p>

<p>Moreover, <i>she was bidden not only to come but to eat</i>.
Whatever there is sweet and comfortable in the Word
of God, ye that are of a broken and contrite spirit are
invited to partake of it. "Jesus Christ came into the
world to save <i>sinners</i>"&mdash;sinners such as you are. "In
due time Christ died for the <i>ungodly</i>"&mdash;such ungodly
ones as you feel yourselves to be. You desire to be
Christ's. You <i>may</i> be Christ's. You are saying in your
heart, "O that I could eat the children's bread!"
You <i>may</i> eat it. You say, "I have no right." But the
Lord gives you the invitation. Come without any other
right than the right of his invitation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"Let not conscience make you linger,</div>
<div class="line small i2">Nor of fitness fondly dream."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But since he bids you "come," take him at his word;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and if there be a promise, believe it; if there be an encouraging
word, accept it, and let the sweetness of it
be yours.</p>

<p>Note further, that she was not only invited to eat
the bread, but to <i>dip her morsel in the vinegar</i>. We must
not look upon this as being some sour stuff. No doubt
there are crabbed souls in the church, who always dip
their morsel in the sourest imaginable vinegar, and with
a grim liberality invite others to share their misery with
them; but the vinegar in my text is altogether another
thing. This was either a compound of various juices
expressed from fruits, or else it was that weak kind of
wine mingled with water which is still commonly used
in the harvest-fields of Italy and the warmer parts of the
world&mdash;a drink not exceedingly strong, but good
enough to impart a relish to the food. It was, to use
the only word which will give the meaning, <i>a sauce</i>,
which the Orientals used with their bread. As we use
butter, or as they on other occasions used oil, so in the
harvest-field, believing it to have cooling properties,
they used what is here called "vinegar." Beloved, the
Lord's reapers have sauce with their bread; they have
not merely doctrines, but the holy unction which is the
essence of doctrines; they have not merely truths, but
a hallowed delight accompanies the truths. Take, for
instance, the doctrine of election, which is like the
bread; there is a sauce to dip it in. When I can say,
"He loved <i>me</i> before the foundations of the world,"
the personal enjoyment of my interest in the truth becomes
a sauce into which I dip my morsel. And you,
poor gleaner, are invited to dip your morsel in it too.
I used to hear people sing that hymn of Toplady's,
which begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"A debtor to mercy alone,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">Of covenant mercy I sing;</div>
<div class="line small ip5">Nor fear, with thy righteousness on,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">My person and offering to bring."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The hymn rises to its climax in the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"Yes, I to the end shall endure,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">As sure as the earnest is given;</div>
<div class="line small ip5">More happy, but not more secure,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">The glorified spirits in heaven."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I used to think I should never be able to sing that hymn.
It was the sauce, you know. I might manage to eat
some of the plain bread, but I could not dip it in that
sauce. It was too high doctrine, too sweet, too consoling.
But I thank God I have since ventured to dip my
morsel in it, and now I hardly like my bread without it.</p>

<p>I would have every trembling sinner partake of the
<i>comfortable</i> parts of God's Word, even those which cavillers
call "<span class="smcap">High Doctrine</span>." Let him believe the
simpler truth first, and then dip it in the sweet doctrine
and be happy in the Lord.</p>

<p>I think I see the gleaner half prepared to come, for
she is very hungry, and she has nothing with her; but
she begins to say, "I have no right to come, for I am
not a reaper; I do nothing for Christ; I am only a <i>selfish
gleaner</i>; I am not a reaper." Ah! but thou art
invited to come. Make no questions about it. Boaz
bids thee; take thou his invitation, and approach at
once. "But," you say, "I am such a <i>poor</i> gleaner;
though my labor is all for myself, yet it is little I win
by it; I get a few thoughts while the sermon is being
preached, but I lose them before I reach home." I know
you do, poor weak-handed woman. But still, Jesus
invites thee. Come! Take thou the sweet promise as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
presents it to thee, and let no bashfulness of thine send
thee home hungry. "But," you say, "I am <i>a stranger</i>;
you do not know my sins, my sinfulness, and the waywardness
of my heart." But Jesus does, and yet he
invites you. He knows you are but a Moabitess, a
stranger from the commonwealth of Israel; but he bids
you come. Is not that enough? "But," you say, "I
owe so much to him already; it is so good of him to
spare my forfeited life, and so tender of him to let me
hear the gospel preached at all; I cannot have the presumption
to be an intruder, and sit with the reapers."
Oh! but he <i>bids</i> you. There is more presumption in
your doubting than there could be in your believing.
<span class="smcap">He</span> bids you. Will you refuse Boaz? Shall Jesus' lips
give the invitation, and will you say him nay? Come,
now, come. Remember that the little which Ruth could
eat did not make Boaz any the poorer; and all that
thou wantest will make Christ none the less glorious or
full of grace. Are thy necessities large? His supplies
are larger. Dost thou require great mercy? He is a
great Saviour. I tell thee that his mercy is no more to
be exhausted than the sea is to be drained. Come at
once. There is enough for thee, and Boaz will not be
impoverished by thy feasting to the full. Moreover, let
me tell thee a secret&mdash;Jesus <i>loves</i> thee; therefore is it
that he would have thee feed at his table. If thou art
now a longing, trembling sinner, willing to be saved,
but conscious that thou deservest it not, Jesus loves
thee, and he will take more delight in seeing thee eat
than thou wilt take in the eating. Let the sweet love
he feels in his soul toward thee draw thee to him. And
what is more&mdash;but this is a great secret, and must only
be whispered in your ear&mdash;<i>he intends to be married to you</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and when you are married to him, why, the fields will
be yours; for, of course, if you are his spouse, you are
joint proprietor with him. Is it not so? Doth not the
wife share with the husband? All those promises which
are "yea and amen in Christ" shall be yours; nay,
they all <i>are</i> yours now, for "the man is next of kin unto
you," and ere long he will take you unto himself forever,
espousing you in faithfulness, and truth, and righteousness.
Will you not eat of your own? "Oh! but,"
says one, "how can it be? I am a stranger." Yes, a
stranger; but Jesus Christ loves the stranger. "A publican,
a sinner;" but he is "the friend of publicans and sinners."
"An outcast;" but he "gathereth together the
outcasts of Israel." "A stray sheep;" but the shepherd
"leaves the ninety and nine" to seek it. "A lost
piece of money;" but he "sweeps the house" to find
thee. "A prodigal son;" but he sets the bells a-ringing
when he knows that thou wilt return. Come,
Ruth! Come, trembling gleaner! Jesus invites thee;
accept the invitation. "At meal-time come thou hither,
and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the
vinegar."</p>


<p class="p2">III. Now, thirdly&mdash;and here is a very sweet point
in the narrative&mdash;<span class="smcap">Boaz reached her the parched
corn</span>. She did "come and eat." Where did she sit?
Note well that she "sat beside the reapers." She did
not feel that she was one of them. Just like some of
you who do not come to the Lord's Supper, but sit and
look on. You are sitting "beside the reapers." You
fear that you are not the people of God; still you love
them, and therefore sit beside them. If there is a good
thing to be had, and you cannot get it, you will sit as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
near as you can to those who <i>do</i> get it. "She sat beside
the reapers."</p>

<p>And while she was sitting there, what happened?
Did she stretch forth her hand and take the food herself?
No, it is written, "<span class="smcap">He</span> reached her the parched corn."
Ah! that is it. None but the Lord of the harvest can
hand out the choicest refreshments of spiritual minds.
I give the invitation in my Master's name, and I hope
I give it earnestly, affectionately, sincerely; but I know
very well that at my poor bidding none will come till
the Spirit draws. No trembling heart will accept divine
refreshing at my hand; unless the King himself comes
near, and reaches the parched corn to each chosen guest,
none will receive it. How does he do this? By his
gracious Spirit, he first of all <i>inspires your faith</i>. You
are afraid to think that it can be true that such a sinner
as you are can ever be "accepted in the Beloved"; he
breathes upon you, and your faint hope becomes an expectancy,
and that expectation buds and blossoms into
an appropriating faith, which says, "Yes, my beloved
is <i>mine</i>, and his desire is toward <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Having done this, the Saviour does more; <i>he sheds
abroad the love of God in your heart</i>. The love of Christ
is like sweet perfume in a box. Now, he who put the
perfume in the box is the only person that knows how
to take off the lid. He, with his own skilful hand,
opens the secret blessing, and sheds abroad the love of
God in the soul.</p>

<p>But Jesus does more than this; he reaches the
parched corn with his own hand, when he <i>gives us close
communion with himself</i>. Do not think that this is a
dream; I tell you there is such a thing as speaking with
Christ to-day. As certainly as I can talk with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
dearest friend, or find solace in the company of my beloved
wife, so surely may I speak with Jesus, and find
intense delight in the company of Immanuel. It is not
a fiction. We do not worship a far-off Saviour; he is a
God nigh at hand. His word is in our mouth and in
our heart, and we do to-day walk with him as the elect
did of old, and commune with him as his apostles did
on earth; not after the flesh, it is true, but after a real
and spiritual fashion.</p>

<p>Yet once more let me add, the Lord Jesus is pleased to
reach the parched corn, in the best sense, when <i>the Spirit
gives us the infallible witness within, that we are "born of
God</i>." A man may know that he is a Christian beyond
all question. Philip de Morny, who lived in the time of
Prince Henry of Navarre, was wont to say that the Holy
Spirit had made his own salvation to him as clear a point
as a problem demonstrated in Euclid. You know with
what mathematical precision the scholar of geometry
solves a problem or proves a proposition, and with
as absolute a precision, as certainly as twice two are
four, we may "know that we have passed from death
unto life." The sun in the heavens is not more clear to
the eye than his present salvation to an assured believer;
such a man could as soon doubt his own existence as
suspect his possession of eternal life.</p>

<p>Now let the prayer be breathed by poor Ruth, who
is trembling yonder. Lord, reach me the parched
corn! "Show me a token for good." "Deal bountifully
with thy servant." "Draw me, we will run after
thee." Lord, send thy love into my heart!</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,</div>
<div class="line small i2">With all thy quickening powers,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">Come, shed abroad a Saviour's love,</div>
<div class="line small i2">And that shall kindle ours."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no getting at Christ except by Christ revealing
himself to us.</p>


<p class="p2">IV. And now the last point. After Boaz had reached
the parched corn, we are told that "<span class="smcap">she did eat, and
was sufficed, and left</span>." So shall it be with every
Ruth. Sooner or later every penitent shall become a
believer, every mourner a singer. There may be a space
of deep conviction, and a period of much hesitation;
but there shall come a season when the soul decides for
the Lord, and cries, "If I perish, I perish. I will go as
I am to Jesus. I will not play the fool any longer with
my <i>buts</i> and <i>ifs</i>, but since he bids me believe that he
died for me, I <i>will</i> believe it, and will trust his cross for
my salvation." Whenever you shall be privileged to
do this, you shall be "<i>satisfied</i>." "She did eat, and
was sufficed." Your <i>head</i> shall be satisfied with the precious
truth which Christ reveals; your <i>heart</i> shall be
content with Jesus, as the altogether lovely object of
affection; your <i>hope</i> shall be filled, for whom have you
in heaven but Christ? Your <i>desire</i> shall be satiated, for
what can even your desire hunger for more than "to
know Christ, and to be found in him." You shall find
Jesus charm your <i>conscience</i>, till it is at perfect peace; he
shall content your <i>judgment</i>, till you know the certainty
of his teachings; he shall supply your <i>memory</i> with recollections
of what he did, and gratify your <i>imagination</i>
with the prospects of what he is yet to do.</p>

<p>"She was sufficed, and left." Some of us have had
deep draughts of love; we have thought that we could
take in all of Christ, but when we have done our best,
we have had to leave a vast remainder. We have sat
down with a ravenous appetite at the table of the Lord's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
love, and said, "Nothing but the infinite can ever satisfy
me," and that infinite has been granted us. I have felt
that I am such a great sinner that nothing short of an
infinite atonement could wash my sins away, and no
doubt you have felt the same; but we have had our sin
removed, and found merit enough and to spare in Jesus;
we have had our hunger relieved, and found a redundance
remaining for others who are in a similar case. There
are certain sweet things in the Word of God which you
and I have not enjoyed yet, and which we cannot enjoy
yet; and these we are obliged to leave for a while, till
we are better prepared to receive them. Did not our
Lord say, "I have yet many things to say unto you,
but ye cannot bear them now"? There is a special
knowledge to which we have not attained, a place of
intimate fellowship with Christ which we have not yet
occupied. There are heights of communion which as
yet our feet have not climbed&mdash;virgin snows of the
mountain of God untrodden by the foot of man. There
is yet a beyond, and there will be for ever.</p>

<p>A verse or two further on we are told what Ruth did
with her leavings. It is very wrong, I believe, at feasts
to carry anything home with you; but <i>she</i> was not under
any such regulation, for that which was left she took
home and gave to Naomi. So it shall be even with you,
poor tremblers, who think you have no right to a morsel
for yourselves; you shall be allowed to eat, and when
you are quite sufficed, you shall have courage to bear
away a portion to others who are hungering at home.
I am always pleased to find the young believer beginning
to pocket something for others. When you hear
a sermon you think, "My poor mother cannot get
out to-day; how I wish she could have been here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
for that sentence would have comforted <i>her</i>. If I
forget everything else, I will tell her that." Cultivate
an unselfish spirit. Seek to love as you have been loved.
Remember that "the law and the prophets" are fulfilled
in this, to love the Lord your God with all your
heart, and your neighbor as yourself. How can you
love your neighbor as yourself if you do not love his
soul? You <i>have</i> loved your own soul; through grace
you have been led to lay hold on Jesus; love your
neighbor's soul, and never be satisfied till you see him
in the enjoyment of those things which are the charm
of your life and the joy of our spirit. Take home your
gleanings for those you love who cannot glean for themselves.</p>

<p>I do not know how to give you an invitation to
Christ more pleasantly, but I would with my whole
heart cry, "Come and welcome to Jesus." I pray my
Lord and Master to reach a handful of parched corn of
comfort to you if you are a trembling sinner, and I also
beg him to make you eat till you are fully sufficed.</p>


<h2><a name="THE_LOADED_WAGON" id="THE_LOADED_WAGON">THE LOADED WAGON.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of
sheaves."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Amos</span> 2:13.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">We</span> have been into the cornfields to glean with Boaz
and Ruth; and I trust that the timid and faint-hearted
have been encouraged to partake of the handfuls which
are let fall on purpose for them by the order of our
generous Lord. We go to-day to the gate of the harvest-field
with another object&mdash;to see the wagon piled up
aloft with many sheaves come creaking forth, making
ruts along the field. We come with gratitude to God,
thanking him for the harvest, blessing him for favorable
weather, and praying him to continue the same till the
last shock of corn shall be brought in, and the husbandmen
everywhere shall shout the "Harvest Home."</p>

<p>What a picture is a wagon loaded with corn of you
and of me, as loaded with God's mercies! From our
cradle up till now, every day has added a sheaf of blessing.
What could the Lord do for us more than he has
done? He has daily loaded us with benefits. Let us
adore his goodness, and yield him our cheerful gratitude.</p>

<p>Alas! that such a sign should be capable of another
reading. Alas! that while God loadeth us with mercy,
we should load him with sin. While he continually
heapeth on sheaf after sheaf of favor we also add
iniquity unto iniquity, till the weight of our sin becomes
intolerable to the Most High, and he cries out by reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of the burden, saying, "I am pressed under you, as a
cart is pressed that is full of sheaves."</p>

<p>Our text begins with a "<i>Behold!</i>" and well it
may. "Beholds" are put in the Bible as signs are
hung out from houses of business, to attract attention.
There is something new, important, deeply impressive,
or worthy of attention wherever we see a "Behold"
in sacred Scripture. I see this "Behold!" standing, as
it were, like a maiden upon the steps of the house of
wisdom, crying, "Turn in hither, O ye that are wise-hearted,
and listen to the voice of God." Let us open
our eyes that we may "behold," and may the Spirit
make a way through our eyes and ears to our hearts,
that repentance and self-abhorrence may take hold upon
us, because of our evil conduct towards our gracious God.</p>

<p>It is to be understood before we proceed farther,
that our text is only a figure, since God cannot actually
be oppressed by man; all the sin that man may commit
can never disturb the serenity of the divine perfection,
nor cause so much as a wave upon his everlasting calm.
He doth but speak to us after the manner of man, and
bring down the sublimities and mysteries of heaven to
the feebleness and ignorance of earth. He speaketh to
us as a great father may talk to his little child. Just
as a cart has the axles bent, and as the wheels creak under
the excessive load, so the Lord says that under the
load of human guilt he is pressed down, until he crieth
out, because he can bear no longer the iniquity of those
that offend against him. We shall now turn to our
first point; may the Holy Ghost make it pointed to our
consciences!</p>

<p>The first and most apparent truth in the text is,
that <span class="smcap">sin is very grievous and burdensome to God</span>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Be astonished, O heavens, and be amazed, O earth,
that God should speak of being pressed and weighed
down! I do not read anywhere so much as half a suggestion
that the whole burden of <i>creation</i> is any weight
to the Most High. "He taketh up the isles as a very
little thing." Neither sun, nor moon, nor stars, nor
all the ponderous orbs which his omnipotence has created,
cost him any labor in their sustenance. The
heathen picture Atlas as stooping beneath the globe;
but the eternal God, who beareth up the pillars of the
universe, "fainteth not, neither is weary." Nor do I
find even the most distant approach to a suggestion that
<i>providence</i> fatigues its Lord. He watches both by
night and day; his power goeth forth every moment.
'Tis he who bringeth forth Mazzaroth in his season and
guideth Arcturus with his sons. He beareth up the
foundations of the earth! and holdeth the cornerstone
thereof. He causeth the dayspring to know its
place, and setteth a bound to darkness and the shadow
of death. All things are supported by the power of his
hand, and there is nothing without him. Just as a
moment's foam subsides into the wave that bears it and
is lost for ever, so would the universe depart if the
eternal God did not daily sustain it. This incessant
working has not diminished his strength, nor is there
any failing or thought of failing with him. He worketh
all things, and when they are wrought they are
as nothing in his sight. But strange, most passing
strange, miraculous among miracles, <i>sin</i> burdens God,
though the world cannot; and iniquity presses the Most
High, though the whole weight of providence is as the
small dust of the balance. Ah, ye careless sons of
Adam, ye think sin a trifle; and as for you, ye sons of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Belial, ye count it sport, and say, "He regardeth not;
he seeth not; how doth God know? and if he knoweth
he careth not for our sins." Learn ye from the Book
of God, that so far from this being the truth, your sins
are a grief to him, a burden and a load to him, till, like
a cart that is overloaded with sheaves, so is he weighed
down with human guilt.</p>

<p>This will be very clear if we meditate for a moment
upon what sin is, and what sin does. <i>Sin is the great
spoiler of all God's works.</i> Sin turned an archangel into
an archfiend, and angels of light into spirits of evil.
Sin looked on Eden and withered all its flowers. Ere
sin had come the Creator said of the new-made earth,
"It is very good"; but when sin had entered, it grieved
God at his very heart that he had made such a creature
as man. Nothing tarnishes beauty so much as sin, for
it mars God's image and erases his superscription.</p>

<p>Moreover, <i>sin makes God's creatures unhappy</i>, and shall
not the Lord, therefore, abhor it? God never designed
that any creature of his hand should be miserable. He
made the creatures on purpose that they should be glad;
he gave the birds their song, the flowers their perfume,
the air its balm; he gave to day the smiling sun and to
night its coronet of stars; for he intended that smiles
should be his perpetual worship, and joy the incense of
his praise. But sin has made God's favorite creature a
wretch, and brought down God's offspring, made in his
own image, to become naked, and poor, and miserable;
and therefore God hateth sin, and is pressed down under
it, because it maketh the objects of his love unhappy
at their heart.</p>

<p>Moreover, remember that <i>sin attacks God in all his
attributes</i>, assails him on his throne, and stabs at his ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>istence.
What is sin? Is it not an insult to God's
<i>wisdom</i>? O sinner, God biddeth thee do his will; when
thou doest the contrary it is because thou dost as much
as say, "I know what is good for me, and God does not
know." You do in effect declare that infinite wisdom
is in error, and that you, the creature of a day, are the
best judge of happiness. Sin impugns God's <i>goodness</i>;
for by sin you declare that God has denied you that
which would make you happy, and this is not the part
of a good, tender, and loving Father. Sin cuts at the
Lord's wisdom with one hand, and at his goodness
with the other.</p>

<p>Sin also abuses the <i>mercy</i> of God. When you, as
many of you have done, sin with the higher hand because
of his long-suffering toward you; when, because
you have no sickness, no losses, no crosses, therefore
you spend your time in revelry and obstinate rebellion&mdash;what
is this but taking the mercy which was meant
for your good and turning it into mischief? It is no
small grief to the loving father to see his substance
spent with harlots in riotous living; he cannot endure
it that his child should be so degraded as to turn even
the mercy which would woo him to repentance into a
reason why he should sin the more against him. Besides,
let me remind the careless and impenitent that
every sin is a defiance of divine <i>power</i>. In effect it is
lifting your puny fists against the majesty of heaven,
and defying God to destroy you. Every time you sin,
you defy the Lord to prove whether he can maintain his
law or no. Is this a slight thing, that a worm, the
creature of a day, should defy the Lord of ages, the God
that filleth and upholdeth all things by the word of his
power? Well may he be weary, when he has to bear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
with such provocations and insults as those! Mention
what attribute you will, and sin has blotted it; speak of
God in any relationship you choose, and sin has cast a
slur upon him. It is evil, only evil, and that continually;
in every view of it must be offensive to the Most
High. Sinner, dost thou know that every act of disobedience
to God's law is virtually an act of <i>high treason</i>?
What dost thou do but seek to be God thyself, thine
own master, thine own lord? Every time thou swervest
from his will, it is to put thy will into his place; it
is to make thyself a god, and to undeify the Most
High. And is this a little offence, to snatch from his
brow the crown, and from his hand the sceptre? I tell
thee it is such an act that heaven itself could not stand
unless it were resented; if this crime were suffered to
go unpunished, the wheels of heaven's commonwealth
would be taken from their axles, and the whole frame
of moral government would be unhinged. Such a treason
against God shall certainly be visited with punishment.</p>

<p>To crown all, <i>sin is an onslaught upon God himself</i>, for
sin is atheism of heart. Let his religious profession be
what it may, the sinner hath said in his heart, "No
God." He wishes that there were no law and no
Supreme Ruler. Is this a trifle? To be a Deicide!
To desire to put God out of his own world! Is this a
thing to be winked at? Can the Most High hear it and
not be pressed down beneath its weight? I pray you
do not think that I would make a needless outcry
against sin and disobedience. It is not in the power of
human imagination to exaggerate the evil of sin, nor
will it ever be possible for mortal lips, though they
should be touched like those of Esaias with a live coal
from off the altar, to thunder out the ten-thousandth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
part of the enormity of the least sin against God.
Think, dear friends! We are his creatures, and yet we
will not do his will. We are fed by him, the breath in
our nostrils he gives us, and yet we spend that breath in
murmuring and rebellion.</p>

<p>Once more, we are always in the sight of our omniscient
God, and yet the presence of God is not enough
to compel us to obedience. Surely if a man should insult
law in the very presence of the lawgiver, that were
not to be borne with; but this is your case and mine.
We must confess, "Against thee, thee only, have I
sinned, and done this evil in thy sight." We must remember
also, that we offend, knowing that we are
offending. We do not sin as the Hottentot, or the cannibal.
We in England sin against extraordinary light
and sevenfold knowledge; and is this a light thing?
Can you expect that God shall pass by wilful and deliberate
offences? Oh, that these lips had language,
that this heart could burn for once! for if I could declare
the horrible infamy of sin it would make the blood
chill in even a haughty Pharaoh's veins, and proud
Nebuchadnezzar would bow his head in fear. It is indeed
a terrible thing to have rebelled against the Most
High. The Lord have mercy upon his servants and
forgive them.</p>

<p>This is our first point, but <i>I</i> cannot teach you it,
God himself must teach it by his Spirit. Oh, that the
Holy Ghost may make you feel that sin is exceedingly
sinful, so that it is grievous and burdensome to God!</p>


<p class="p2">Secondly, <span class="smcap">some sins are more especially grievous
to God</span>. The connection of our text will help you to
see the force of this observation.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no such thing as a little sin, but still there
are degrees of guilt, and it were folly to say that a sinful
thought hath in it the same extent of evil as a sinful
act. A filthy imagination is sinful&mdash;wholly sinful and
greatly sinful, but still a filthy act has attained a higher
degree of provocation. There are sins which especially
provoke God. In the connection of the text we read
that <i>licentiousness</i> does this. The Jewish people in the
days of Amos seem to have gone to a very high degree
of fornication and lechery. This sin is not uncommon
in our day; let our midnight streets and our divorce
courts be the witness. I say no more. Let each one
keep his body pure; for want of chastity is a grievous
evil before the Lord.</p>

<p><i>Oppression</i>, too, according to the prophet, is another
great provocation to God. The prophet speaks of selling
the poor for a pair of shoes; and some would grind
the widow and the orphan, and make the laborer toil
for nought. How many business men have no "bowels
of compassion." Men form themselves into societies,
and then exact an outrageous usury upon loans from
the unhappy beings who fall into their hands. Cunning
legal quibbles and crafty evasions of just debts
often amount to heavy oppression, and are sure to
bring down the anger of the Most High.</p>

<p>Then, again, it seems that <i>idolatry</i> and <i>blasphemy</i> are
highly offensive to God, and have a high degree of
heinousness. He says that the people drank the wine
of false gods. If any man sets up his belly, or his gold,
or his wealth as his god, and if he lives to these instead
of living to the Most High, he hath offended by idolatry.
Woe to such, and equal woe to those who adore
crosses, sacraments, or images.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Specially is <i>blasphemy</i> a God-provoking sin. For
blasphemy there is no excuse. As George Herbert says,
"Lust and wine plead a pleasure;" there is gain to be
pleaded for avarice, "but the cheap swearer from his
open sluice lets his soul run for nought." There is
nothing gained by profane talk; there can be no pleasure
in cursing; this is offending for offending's sake,
and hence it is a high and crying sin, which makes the
Lord grow weary of men. There may be some among
you to whom these words may be personal accusations.
Do I address the lecherous, or the oppressive, or the
profane? Ah, soul, what a mercy God hath borne with
thee so long; the time will come, however, when he
will say, "Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries," and
how easily will he cast you off and appoint you an awful
destruction.</p>

<p>Again, while some sins are thus grievous to God
for their peculiar heinousness, many men are especially
obnoxious to God because of the <i>length</i> of their sin.
That gray-headed man, how many times has he provoked
the Most High! Why, those who are but lads have
cause to count their years and apply their hearts unto
wisdom because of the length of time they have lived
in rebellion; but what shall I say of you who have been
half a century in open war against God&mdash;and some of
you sixty, seventy, what if I said near upon eighty
years? Ah, you have had eighty years of mercies, and
returned eighty years of neglect: for eighty years of
patience you have rendered eighty years of ingratitude.
O God, well mayest thou be wearied by the length and
number of man's sins!</p>

<p>Furthermore, God taketh special note and feeleth
an especial weariness of sin that is mixed with <i>obstinacy</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Oh how obstinate some men are! They <i>will</i> be damned;
there is no helping them; they seem as if they would
leap the Alps to reach perdition, and swim through
seas of fire that they may destroy their souls. I
might tell you cases of men that have been sore sick of
fever, ague, and cholera, and they have only recovered
their health to return to their sins. Some of them have
had troubles in business, thick and threefold: they were
once in respectable circumstances, but they spent their
living riotously, and they became poor; yet they still
struggle on in sin. They are growing poorer every day,
most of their clothes have gone to the pawnshop; but
they will not turn from the tavern and the brothel.
Another child is dead! The wife is sick, and starvation
stares the family in the face; but they go on still with
a high hand and an outstretched arm. This is obstinacy,
indeed. Sinner! God will let thee have thine
own way one of these days, and that way will be thine
everlasting ruin. God is weary of those who set themselves
to do mischief, and, against warnings, and invitations,
and entreaties, are determined to go on in sin.</p>

<p>The context seems to tell us that <i>ingratitude</i> is intensely
burdensome to God. He tells the people how
he brought them out of Egypt; how he cast out the
Amorites; how he raised up their sons for prophets,
and their young men for Nazarites; and yet they rebelled
against him! This was one of the things that
pricked my heart when I first came to God as a guilty
sinner, not so much the peculiar heinousness of my outward
life, as the peculiar mercies that I had enjoyed.
How generous God has been to some of us&mdash;some of us
who never had a want! God has never cast us into
poverty, nor left us to infamy, nor given us up to evil ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>ample,
but he has kept us moral, and made us love his
house even when we did not love <i>him</i>, and all this he
has done year after year: and what poor returns we
have made! To us, his people, what joy he has given,
what deliverances, what love, what comfort, what bliss&mdash;and
yet we have sinned to his face! Well may he be
as a cart that is pressed down, that is full of sheaves.</p>

<p>Let me observe, before I leave this point, that it
seems from our text, that the Lord is so pressed, that
<i>he even crieth out</i>. Just as the cart when laden with the
sheaves, groaneth under the weight, so the Lord crieth
out under the load of sin. Have you never heard those
accents? "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth:
for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought
up children, and they have rebelled against me!"
Hear again: "Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways;
for why will ye die, O house of Israel?" Better still,
hear the lament from the lip of Jesus, soft and gentle
as the dew&mdash;"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest
the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee,
how often would I have gathered thy children together,
even as a hen gathereth her chickens under
her wings, and ye would not!" Sinner, God is cut to
the heart by thy sin; thy Creator grieves over that
which thou laughest at; thy Saviour crieth out in his
spirit concerning that which thou thinkest to be a trifle&mdash;"O
do not this abominable thing which I hate!"
For God's sake do it not! We often say "for God's
sake," without knowing what we mean; but here see
what it means, for the sake of God, that ye grieve not
your Creator, that ye cause not the Eternal One himself
to cry out by reason of weariness of you. Cease ye,
cease ye, from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
house of Israel? I now leave those two points to pass
on very briefly to the next.</p>


<p class="p2">While it is true that sin is grievous to the Lord, it
magnifies his mercy when we see that <span class="smcap">he bears the
load.</span> As the cart is not said to break, but is pressed
only, so is he pressed, and yet he bears. If you and I
were in God's place, should we have borne it? Nay,
within a week we should have burned the universe with
fire, or trodden it to powder beneath our feet. If the
Law of heaven were as swift to punish as the law of
man, where were we? How easily could he avenge his
honor! How many servants wait around him ready to
do his bidding! As the Roman consul went out, attended
by his lictors carrying the axe, so God is ever
attended by his executioners, who are ready to fulfil his
sentence. A stone, a tile from a roof, a thunderbolt, a
puff of wind, a grain of dust, a whiff of gas, a broken
blood-vessel, and all is over, and you are dead, and in
the hands of an angry God. Indeed, the Lord has to
restrain the servants of his anger, for the heavens cry,
"Why should we cover that wretch's head?" Earth
asks, "Why should I yield at harvest to the sinner's
plough?" The lightnings thunder, and say, "Let us
smite the rebel," and the seas roar upon the sinner, desiring
him as their prey. There is no greater proof of
the omnipotence of God than his long-suffering; for it
shows the greatest possible power for God to be able to
control himself. Sinner, yet Jehovah bears with thee.
The angels have been astonished at it; they thought he
would strike, but yet he bears with you. Have you
ever seen a patient man insulted? He has been met in
the street by a villain, who insults him before a mob of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
boys. He bears it. The fellow spits in his face. He
bears it still. The offender strikes him. He endures it
quietly. "Give him in charge," says one. "No," says
he, "I forgive him all." The fellow knocks him down,
and rolls him in the kennel, but he bears it still; yes, and
when he rises all covered with mire, he says, "If there
be anything that I can do to befriend you, I will do it
now." Just at that moment the wretch is arrested by
a sheriff's officer for debt; the man who has been insulted
takes out his purse and pays the debt, and says,
"You may go free." See, the wretch spits in his face
after that! "Now," you say, "let the law have its
way with him." Is there any room for patience now?
So would it have been with man; it has not been so
with God. Though like the cart he is pressed under
the load of sheaves, yet like the cart the axle does not
break. He bears the load. He bears with impenitent
sinners still.</p>


<p class="p2">And this brings me to the fourth head, on which I
would have your deepest attention. Some of you, I fear,
have never seen sin in the light of grieving God, or else
you would not wish to grieve him any more. On the
other hand some of you feel how bitter a thing evil is,
and you wish to be rid of it. This is our fourth head.
Not only doth God still bear with sin, but <span class="smcap">God, in the
person of his Son, did bear and take away sin</span>.</p>

<p>These words would have deep meaning if put into
the lips of Jesus&mdash;"I am pressed under you, as a cart
is pressed that is full of sheaves." Here stood the great
problem. God must punish sin, and yet he desired to
have mercy. How could it be? Lo! Jesus comes to
be the substitute for all who trust him. The load of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
guilt is laid upon his shoulders. See how they pile on
him the sheaves of human sin!</p>

<p>"The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."
There they lie, sheaf on sheaf, till he is pressed down
like the wain that groaneth as it moves along. "He is
despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief." See him, he did "sweat as it
were great drops of blood falling to the ground."
Herod mocks him. Pilate jeers him. They have smitten
the Prince of Judah upon the cheek. "I gave my
back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked
off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting."
They have tied him to the pillar; they are beating
him with rods, not this time forty stripes <i>save one</i>, for
there is no "save one" with him. "The chastisement
of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are
healed." See him; like a cart pressed down with
sheaves traversing the streets of Jerusalem. Well may
ye weep, ye daughters of Jerusalem, though he bids ye
dry your tears! Abjects hoot at him as he walks along
bowed beneath the load of his own cross, which was the
emblem of our sin. They bring him to Golgotha.
They throw him on his back, they stretch out his hands
and his feet. The accursed iron penetrates the tenderest
part of his body, where most the nerves do congregate.
They lift up the cross. O bleeding Saviour,
thy time of woe is come! They dash it into the socket
with cruel force, the nails are tearing through his hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and feet. He hangeth in extremity, for God hath forsaken
him; his enemies persecute and take him, for
there is none to deliver him. They mock his nakedness;
they point at his agonies. They look and stare upon him.
With ribald jests they insult his griefs. They make puns
upon his prayers. He is now indeed a worm, and no
man, crushed till you can scarcely think that divinity
dwells within him. Fever parches him; his tongue is
dried up like a potsherd, and he cries, "I thirst!" Vinegar
is all they yield him. The sun refuses to shine, and
the dense midnight of that awful mid-day is a fitting
emblem of the tenfold darkness of his soul. Out of
that all-encompassing horror he crieth, "My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Then, indeed, was
he pressed down! There was never sorrow like unto
his sorrow. All mortal griefs found a reservoir in his
heart, and the punishment of human guilt spent itself
upon his body and his soul. Shall sin ever be a trifle to
me? Shall I laugh at that which made my Saviour
groan? Shall I toy and dally with that which stabbed
him to the heart? Sinner, wilt thou not give up thy
sins for the sake of him who suffered for sin? "Yes,"
sayest thou, "yes, if I could believe that he suffered for
my sake." Wilt thou trust thy soul in his hands at
once? Dost thou do so? Then he died <i>for thee</i> and
took <i>thy</i> guilt, and carried all <i>thy</i> sorrows, and thou
mayest go free, for God is satisfied, and thou art absolved.
Christ was burdened that thou mightest be
lightened; he was pressed that thou mightest be free.
I would I could talk of my precious Master as John
would speak, who saw him and bare witness, for he
could tell in plaintive tones of the sorrows of Calvary.
Such as I have I give you; oh that God would give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
you with it the power, the grace to believe on Jesus at
once.</p>


<p class="p2">V. For if not, and here is our last point, God will
only bear the load of our provocation for a little while;
and if we are not in Christ when the end shall come,
<span class="smcap">that same load will crush us forever</span>.</p>

<p>My text is translated by many learned men in a
different way from the version before us. According
to them it should be read, "I will press you as a cart
that is full of sheaves presseth your place." That is, just
as a heavy loaded wagon pressed into the soft eastern
roads and left deep furrows, so will I crush you, saith
God, beneath the load of your sin. This is to be your
doom, my hearer, if you are out of Christ: your own
deeds are to press upon you. Need we enlarge upon
this terror? I think not. It only needs that you
should make a personal application of the threatening!
Divide yourselves now. Divide yourselves, I say!
Answer each one for himself&mdash;Dost thou believe on the
Lord Jesus Christ? then the threatening is not thine.
But if thou believest not I conjure thee listen to me
now as if thou wert the only person here. A Christless
soul will ere long be a castaway; he that believeth not
in Christ is condemned already, because he believeth not.
How wilt thou escape if thou wilt neglect so great salvation?
Thus saith the Lord unto thee, "Consider
thy ways." By time, by eternity, by life, by death, by
heaven, by hell, I do conjure thee believe in him who
is able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto
him; but if thou believest not in Christ thou shalt die
in thy sins.</p>

<p>After death the judgment! Oh! the judgment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the thundering trumpet, the multitude, the books, the
great white throne, the "Come, ye blessed," the "Depart,
ye cursed!"</p>

<p>After judgment, to a soul that is out of Christ,
Hell! Who among us? who <i>among us</i> shall abide with
the devouring flame? Who among <span class="smcap">us</span>? Who among
<span class="smcap">us</span> shall dwell with everlasting burnings? I pray that
none of us may. But we <i>must</i> unless we fly to Christ.
I beseech thee, my dear hearer, fly to Jesus! I may
never see thy face again; thine eyes may never look
into mine again; but I shake my skirts of thy blood
if thou believest not in Christ. My tears entreat thee;
let his long-suffering lead thee to repentance. He willeth
not the death of any, but that they should turn unto
him and live: and this turning lies mainly in trusting
Jesus with your soul. Wilt thou believe in Christ?
Nay, I know thou wilt not unless the Spirit of God
shall constrain thee; but if thou wilt not, it shall not
be for want of pleading and entreating. Come, 'tis
mercy's welcome hour. I pray thee, come. Jesus with
pierced hands invites thee, though thou hast long rejected
him. He knocks again. His unconquerable
love defies thy wickedness. He begs thee to be saved.
Sinner, wilt thou have him or no? "Whosoever will,
let him come and take of the water of life freely." God
help you to come, for the glorious Redeemer's sake.
Amen.</p>



<h2><a name="THRESHING" id="THRESHING">THRESHING.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a
cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with
a staff, and the cummin with a rod. Bread corn is bruised; because he will
not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it
with his horsemen."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> 28:27, 28.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> art of husbandry was taught to man by God.
He would have starved while he was discovering it, and
so the Lord, when he sent him out of the Garden of
Eden, gave him a measure of elementary instruction in
agriculture, even as the prophet puts it&mdash;"His God
doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him."
God has taught man to plough, to break the clods, to
sow the different kinds of grain, and to thresh out the
different sorts of seeds.</p>

<p>The Eastern husbandman could not thresh by
machinery as we do; but still he was ingenious and
discreet in that operation. Sometimes a heavy instrument
was dragged over the corn to tear out the grain.
This is what is intended in the first clause by the "threshing
instrument," as also in that passage, "I have made
thee a sharp threshing instrument having teeth." When
the corn-drag was not used, they often turned the heavy
solid wheel of a country cart over the straw. This is
alluded to in the next sentence: "Neither is a cart
wheel turned about upon the cummin." They had also
flails not very unlike our own, and then for still smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
seeds, such as dill and cummin, they used a simple staff,
or a slender switch. "The fitches are beaten out with
a staff, and the cummin with a rod."</p>

<p>This is not the time or place to give a dissertation
upon threshing. We find every information upon that
subject in proper books; but the meaning of the illustration
is this&mdash;that as God has taught husbandmen to
distinguish between different kinds of grain in the
threshing, so does he in his infinite wisdom deal discreetly
with different sorts of men. He does not try us
all alike, seeing we are differently constituted. He
does not pass us all through the same agony of conviction:
we are not all to the same extent threshed with
terrors. He does not give us all to endure the same
family or bodily affliction; one escapes with only being
beaten with a rod, while another feels, as it were, the
feet of horses in his heavy tribulations.</p>

<p>Our subject is just this. <i>Threshing</i>: all kinds of
seeds need it, <i>all sorts of men need it</i>. Secondly, <i>the
threshing is done with discretion</i>, and, thirdly, <i>the threshing
will not last forever</i>; for so the second verse of the text
says: "Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever
be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart,
nor bruise it with his horseman."</p>


<p class="p2">I. First, then, <span class="smcap">we all need threshing</span>. Some have
a foolish conceit of themselves that they have no sin;
but they deceive themselves, and the truth is not in
them. The best of men are men at the best; and
being men, they are not perfect, but are still compassed
about with infirmity. What is the object of threshing
the grain? Is it not to separate it from the straw and
the chaff?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p><i>About the best of men there is still a measure of chaff.</i> All
is not grain that lies upon the threshing-floor. All is not
grain even in those golden sheaves which have been
brought into our garner so joyfully. Even the wheat is
joined to the straw, which was necessary to it at one
time. About the kernel of the wheat the husk is wrapped,
and this still clings to it even when it lies upon the
threshing-floor. About the holiest of men there is
something superfluous, something which must be removed.
We either sin by omission or by trespass.
Either in spirit, or motive, or lack of zeal, or want of
discretion, we are faulty. If we escape one error, we
usually glide into its opposite. If before an action we
are right, we err in the doing of it, or, if not, we become
proud after it is over. If sin be shut out at the front
door, it tries the back gate, or climbs in at the window,
or comes down the chimney. Those who cannot perceive
it in themselves are frequently blinded by its
smoke. They are so thoroughly in the water that they
do not know that it rains. So far as my own observation
goes I have found out no man whom the old divines
would have called perfectly perfect; the absolutely all-round
man is a being whom I expect to see in heaven,
but not in this poor fallen world. We all need such
cleansing and purging as the threshing-floor is intended
to work for us.</p>

<p>Now, <i>threshing is useful in loosening the connection
between the good corn and the husk</i>. Of course, if it would
slip out easily from its husk, the corn would only need
to be shaken. There would be no necessity for a staff or
a rod, much less for the feet of horses, or the wheel of
a cart to separate it. But there's the rub: our soul not
only lieth in the dust, but "cleaveth" to it. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
a fearful intimacy between fallen human nature and
the evil which is in the world; and this compact is not
soon broken. In our hearts we hate every false way,
and yet we sorrowfully confess, "When I would do
good, evil is present with me." Sometimes when our
spirit cries out most ardently after God, a holy will is
present with us, but how to perform that which is
good we find not. Flesh and blood have tendencies and
weaknesses which, if not sinful in themselves, yet tend in
that direction. Appetites need but slight excitement to
germinate into lusts. It is not easy for us to forget our
own kindred and our father's house even when the
king doth most greatly desire our beauty. Our alien
nature remembers Egypt and the flesh-pots while yet
the manna is in our mouths. We were all born in the
house of evil, and some of us were nursed upon the lap
of iniquity, so that our first companionships were among
the heirs of wrath. That which was bred in the bone
is hard to get out of the flesh. Threshing is used to
loosen our hold of earthly things and break us away
from evil. This needs a divine hand, and nothing but
the grace of God can make the threshing effectual.
Something is done by threshing when the soul ceases to
be bound up with its sin, and sin is no longer pleasurable
or satisfactory. Still, as the work of threshing is
never done till the corn is separated altogether from
the husk, so chastening and discipline have never accomplished
their design till God's people give up every
form of evil, and abhor all iniquity. When we shake
right out of the straw, and have nothing further to do
with sin, then the flail will lie quiet. It has taken a
good deal of threshing to bring some of us anywhere near
that mark, and I am afraid many more heavy blows will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
be struck before we shall reach the total separation.
From a certain sort of sins we are very easily separated
by the grace of God early in our spiritual life; but when
those are gone, another layer of evils comes into sight,
and the work has to be repeated. The complete removal
of our connection with sin is a work demanding the
divine skill and power of the Holy Ghost, and by him
only will it be accomplished.</p>

<p>Threshing becomes needful for the sake of our usefulness;
for the wheat must come out of the husk to be
of service. We can only honor God and bless men by
being holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from
sinners. O corn of the Lord's threshing-floor, thou
must be beaten and bruised, or perish as a worthless
heap! Eminent usefulness usually necessitates eminent
affliction.</p>

<p>Unless thus severed from sin, we cannot be gathered
into the garner. God's pure wheat must not be defiled
by an admixture of chaff. There shall in nowise
enter into heaven anything that defileth, therefore every
sort of imperfection must come away from us by some
means or other ere we can enter into the state of eternal
blessedness and perfection. Yea, even here we cannot
have true fellowship with the Father unless we are
daily delivered from sin.</p>

<p>Peradventure some of us to-day are lying up on the
threshing-floor, suffering from the blows of chastisement.
What then? Why, let us rejoice therein; for
<i>this testifies to our value in the sight of God</i>. If the wheat
were to cry out and say, "The great drag has gone over
me, therefore the husbandman has no care for me," we
should instantly reply&mdash;The husbandman does not pass
the corn-drag over the darnel or the nettles; it is only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
over the precious wheat that he turns the wheel of his
cart, or the feet of his oxen. Because he esteems the
wheat, therefore he deals sternly with it and spares it
not. Judge not, O believer, that God hates you because
he afflicts you; but interpret truly and see that he
honors you by every stroke which he lays upon you.
Thus saith the Lord, "You only have I known of all
the nations of the earth, therefore I will punish you
for all your iniquities." Because a full atonement has
been made by the Lord Jesus for all his people's sins,
therefore he will not punish us as a judge; but because
we are his dear children, therefore he will chastise us
as a father. In love he corrects his own children that
he may perfect them in his own image, and make them
partakers of his holiness. Is it not written, "I will
bring them under the rod of the covenant"? Has he
not said, "I have refined thee, but not with silver, I
have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction"? Therefore
do not judge according to the sight of the eyes or
the feeling of the flesh, but judge according to faith, and
understand that, as threshing is a testimony to the value
of the wheat, so affliction is a token of God's delight in
his people.</p>

<p>Remember, however, that as threshing is a sign of
the impurity of the wheat, so is <i>affliction an indication of
the present imperfection of the Christian</i>. If you were no
more connected with evil, you would be no more corrected
with sorrow. The sound of a flail is never heard
in heaven, for it is not the threshing-floor of the imperfect
but the garner of the completely sanctified.
The threshing instrument is therefore a humbling token,
and so long as we feel it we should humble ourselves
under the hand of God, for it is clear that we are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
yet free from the straw and the chaff of fallen
nature.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the instrument is <i>a prophecy of
our future perfection</i>. We are undergoing from the hand
of God a discipline which will not fail: we shall by his
prudence and wisdom be clean delivered from the
husk of sin. We are feeling the blows of the staff, but
we are being effectually separated from the evil which
has so long surrounded us, and for certain we shall one
day be pure and perfect. Every tendency to sin shall
be beaten off. "Foolishness is bound in the heart
of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it
far from him." If, we being evil, yet succeed with
our children by our poor, imperfect chastening, how
much more shall the Father of spirits cause us to live
unto himself by his holy discipline? If the corn could
know the necessary uses of the flail, it would invite the
thresher to his work; and since we know whereunto
tribulation tendeth, let us glory in it, and yield ourselves
with cheerfulness to its processes. We need threshing,
the threshing proves our value in God's sight, and while
it marks our imperfection, it secures our ultimate
cleansing.</p>


<p class="p2">II. Secondly, I would remark that <span class="smcap">God's threshing
is done with great discretion</span>; "for the fitches are
not threshed with a threshing instrument." The poor little
fitches, a kind of small seed used for flavoring cakes,
were not crushed out with a heavy drag, for by such
rough usage they would have been broken up and spoiled.
"Neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the
cummin;" this little seed, perhaps the carraway, would
have been ground by so great a weight; it would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
been preposterous to treat it in that rough manner.
The fitches were soon removed from the stalks by being
"beaten out with a staff," and the cummin needed
nothing but a touch of a rod. For tender seeds the
farmer uses gentle means, and for the hardier grains he
reserves the sterner processes. Let us think of this,
as it conveys a valuable spiritual lesson.</p>

<p>Reflect, my brother, that your threshing and mine
<i>are in God's hands</i>. Our chastening is not left to servants,
much less to enemies; "we are chastened of the
Lord!" The Great Husbandman himself personally
bids the laborers do this and that, for they know not the
time or the way except as divine wisdom shall direct;
they would turn the wheel upon the cummin, or
attempt to thresh wheat with a staff. I have seen God's
servants trying both these follies; they have crushed
the weak and tender, and they have dealt with partiality
and softness with those who needed to be sternly rebuked.
How roughly some ministers, some elders,
some good men and women will go to work with timid,
tender souls; yet we need not fear that they will destroy
the true-hearted, for, however much they may vex
them the Lord will not leave his chosen in their hands,
but will overrule their mistaken severity, and preserve
his own from being destroyed thereby. How glad I am
of this; for there are many nowadays who would grind
the tender ones to powder if they could!</p>

<p>As the Lord has not left us in the power of man, so
also he has not left us in the power of the devil. Satan
may sift us as wheat, but he shall not thresh us as
fitches. He may blow away the chaff from us even
with his foul breath, but he shall not have the management
of the Lord's corn: "the Lord preserveth the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
righteous." Not a stroke in providence is left to
chance; the Lord ordains it, and arranges the time, the
force, and the place of it. The divine decree leaves
nothing uncertain; the jurisdiction of supreme love
occupies itself with the smallest events of our daily
lives. Whether we bear the teeth of the corn-drag or
men do ride over our heads, or we endure the gentler
touches of the divine hand, everything is by appointment,
and the appointment is fixed by infallible wisdom.
Let this be a mine of comfort to the afflicted.</p>

<p>Next, remark that <i>the instruments used for our threshing
are chosen also by the Great Husbandman</i>. The Eastern
farmer, according to the text, has several instruments,
and so has our God. No form of threshing is pleasant
to the seed which bears it; indeed, each one seems to
the sufferer to be peculiarly objectionable. We say,
"I think I could bear anything but this sad trouble."
We cry, "It was not an enemy, then I could have
borne it," and so on. Perhaps the tender cummin foolishly
fancies that the horse-hoofs would be a less terrible
ordeal than the rod, and the fitches might even prefer
the wheel to the staff; but happily the matter is left
to the choice of One who judges unerringly. What
dost thou know about it, poor sufferer? How canst thou
judge of what is good for thee? "Ah!" cries a mother,
"I would not mind poverty; but to lose my darling
child is too terrible!" Another laments, "I could have
parted with all my wealth, but to be slandered cuts me
to the quick." There is no pleasing us in the matter
of chastisement. When I was at school, with my
uncle for master, it often happened that he would send
me out to find a cane for him. It was not a very pleasant
task, and I noticed that I never once succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
selecting a stick which was liked by the boy who had to
feel it. Either it was too thin, or too stout; and in
consequence I was threatened by the sufferers with
condign punishment if I did not do better next time. I
learned from that experience never to expect God's
children to like the particular rod with which they are
chastened. You smile at my simile, but you may smile
at yourself when you find yourself crying, "Any trouble
but this, Lord. Any affliction but this." How idle it
is to expect a pleasant trial; for it would then be no
trial at all. Almost every really useful medicine is unpleasant:
almost all effectual surgery is painful! no
trial for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous,
yet it is the right trial, and none the less right because
it is bitter.</p>

<p>Notice, too, that God not only selects the instruments,
<i>but he chooses the place</i>. Farmers in the East
have large threshing-floors upon which they throw the
sheaves of corn or barley, and upon these they turn
horses and drags; but near the house door I have often
noticed in Italy a much smaller circle of hardened clay or
cement, and here I have seen the peasants beating out
their garden seeds in a more careful manner than would
naturally be used toward the greater heaps upon the
larger area. Some saints are not afflicted in the common
affairs of life, but they have peculiar sorrow in
their innermost spirits; they are beaten on the smaller
and more private threshing-floor; but the process is
none the less effectual. How foolish are we when we
rebel against our Lord's appointment, and speak as
if we had a right to choose our own afflictions!
"Should it be according to thy mind?" Should
a child select the rod? Should the grain appoint its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
own thresher? Are not these things to be left to a
higher wisdom? Some complain of the time of their
trial; it is hard to be crippled in youth, or to be poor
in age, or to be widowed when your children are young.
Yet in all this there is wisdom. A part of the skill of
the physician may lie, not only in writing a prescription,
but in arranging the hours at which the medicine shall
be taken. One draught may be most useful in the morning,
and another may be more beneficial in the evening;
and so the Lord knows when it is best for us to drink
of the cup which he has prepared for us. I know a
dear child of God who is enduring a severe trial in his
old age, and I would fain screen him from it because
of his feebleness, but our heavenly Father knows best,
and there we must leave it. The instrument of the
threshing, the place, the measure, the time, the end,
are all appointed by infallible love.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice in the text the limit of
this threshing. The husbandman is zealous to beat out
the seed, but he is careful not to break it in pieces by
too severe a process. His wheel is not to grind, but to
thresh; the horses' feet are not to break, but to separate.
He intends to get the cummin out of its husk, but
he will not turn a heavy drag upon it utterly to smash
it up and destroy it. In the same way the Lord has a
measure in all his chastening. Courage, tried friend,
you shall be afflicted as you need, but not as you deserve;
tribulation shall come as you are able to bear it.
As is the strength such shall the affliction be; the
wheat may feel the wheel, but the fitches shall bear
nothing heavier than a staff. No saint shall be tempted
beyond the proper measure, and the limit is fixed by
a tenderness which never deals a needless stroke.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very easy to talk like this in cool blood, and
quite another thing to remember it when the flail is
hammering you; yet have I personally realized this
truth upon the bed of pain, and in the furnace of
mental distress. I thank God at every remembrance
of my afflictions; I did not doubt his wisdom then, nor
have I had any reason to question it since. Our Great
Husbandman understands how to divide us from the
husk, and he goes about his work in a way for which he
deserves to be adored for ever.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant thought that God's limit is one beyond
which trials never go&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"If trials six be fix'd for men</div>
<div class="line small i2">They shall not suffer seven.</div>
<div class="line small ip5">If God appoint afflictions ten</div>
<div class="line small i2">They ne'er can be eleven."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The old law ordained forty stripes save one, and in
all our scourgings there always comes in that "save
one." When the Lord multiplies our sorrows up to a
hundred, it is because ninety-and-nine failed to effect
his purpose; but all the powers of earth and hell cannot
give us one blow above the settled number. We
shall never endure a superfluity of threshing. The
Lord never sports with the feelings of his saints. "He
does not afflict willingly," and so we may be sure he
never gives an unnecessary blow.</p>

<p>The wisdom of the husbandman in limiting his
threshing is far exceeded in the wisdom of God by which
he sets a limit to our griefs. Some escape with little
trouble, and perhaps it is because they are frail and
sensitive. The little garden seeds must not be beaten
too heavily lest they be injured; those saints who bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
about with them a delicate body must not be roughly
handled, nor shall they be. Possibly they have a feeble
mind also, and that which others would laugh at would
be death to them; they shall be kept as the apple of
the eye.</p>

<p>If you are free from tribulation never ask for it;
that would be a great folly. I did meet with a brother
a little while ago who said that he was much perplexed
because he had no trouble. I said, "Do not worry
about <i>that</i>; but be happy while you may." Only a
queer child would beg to be flogged. Certain sweet
and shining saints are of such a gentle spirit that the
Lord does not expose them to the same treatment as he
metes out to others; they do not need it, and they
could not bear it; why should they wish for it?</p>

<p>Others, again, are very heavily pressed; but what
of that if they are a superior grain, a seed of larger usefulness,
intended for higher purposes? Let not such regret
that they have to endure a heavier threshing since
their use is greater. It is the bread corn that must go
under the feet of the horseman and must feel the wheel
of the cart; and so the most useful have to pass
through the sternest processes. There is not one
among us but what would say, "I could wish that I
were Martin Luther, or that I could play as noble a part
as he did." Yes; but in addition to the outward perils
of his life, the inward experiences of that remarkable
man were such as none of us would wish to feel. He
was frequently tormented with Satanic temptations, and
driven to the verge of despair. At one hour he rode
the whirlwind and the storm, master of all the world,
and then after days of fighting with the pope and the
devil he would go home to his bed and lie there broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>-down
and trembling. You see God's heroes only in
the pulpit, or in other public places, you know not what
they are before God in secret. You do not know their
inner life; else you might discover that the bread corn
is bruised, and that those who are most useful in comforting
others have to endure frequent sorrow themselves.
Envy no man; for you do not know how he
may have to be threshed to make him right and keep
him so.</p>

<p>Brethren, we see that our God uses discretion in
the chastisement of his people; let us use a loving
prudence when we have to deal with others in that way.
Be gentle as well as firm with your children; and if
you have to rebuke your brother do it very tenderly.
Do not drive your horses over the tender seed. Recollect
that the cummin is beaten out with a staff and not
crushed out with a wheel. Take a very light rod.
Perhaps it would be as well if you had no rod at all,
but left that work to wiser hands. Go you and sow and
leave your elders to thresh.</p>

<p>Next let us firmly believe in God's discretion, and
be sure that he is doing the right thing by us. Let us
not be anxious to be screened from affliction. When
we ask that the cup may pass from us let it be with a
"nevertheless not as I will." Best of all, let us freely
part with our chaff. The likeliest way to escape the
flail is to separate from the husk as quickly as possible.
"Come ye out from among them." Separate yourselves
from sin and sinners, from the world and worldliness,
and the process of threshing will all the sooner
be completed. God make us wise in this matter!</p>


<p class="p2">III. A word or two is all we can afford upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
third head, which is that <span class="smcap">the threshing will not last
forever</span>.</p>

<p>The threshing will not last all our days even here:
"Bread corn is bruised, but he will not always be
threshing it." Oh, no. "For a small moment have I
forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather
thee." "He will not always chide, neither will he keep
his anger for ever." "Weeping may endure for a
night, but joy cometh in the morning." Rejoice, ye
daughters of sorrow! Be comforted, ye sons of grief!
Have hope in God, for you shall yet praise him who is
the health of your countenance. The rain does not
always fall, nor will the clouds always return. Sorrow
and sighing shall flee away. Threshing is not an operation
which the corn requires all the year round; for the
most part the flail is idle. Bless the Lord, O my soul!
The Lord will yet bring home his banished ones.</p>

<p>Above all, tribulation will not last forever, for we
shall soon be gone to another and better world. We
shall soon be carried to the land where there are neither
threshing-floors nor corn-drags. I sometimes think I
hear the herald calling me. His trumpet sounds: "Up
and away! Boot and saddle! Up and away! Leave
the camp and the battle, and return in triumph." The
night is far spent with you, but the morning cometh.
The daylight breaks above yon hills. The day is coming&mdash;the
day that shall go no more down forever.
Come, eat your bread with joy, and march onward with
a merry heart; for the land which floweth with milk
and honey is but a little way before you. Until the day
break and the shadows flee away, abide the Great
Husbandman's will, and may the Lord glorify himself
in you. Amen.</p>


<h2><a name="WHEAT_IN_THE_BARN" id="WHEAT_IN_THE_BARN">WHEAT IN THE BARN.</a></h2>

<p class="small">"Gather the wheat into my barn."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> 13:30.</p>


<p class="p2">"<span class="smcap">Gather</span> the wheat into my barn." Then the purpose
of the Son of man will be accomplished. He sowed
good seed, and he shall have his barn filled with it at
the last. Be not dispirited, Christ will not be disappointed.
"He shall see of the travail of his soul, and
shall be satisfied." He went forth weeping, bearing
precious seed, but he shall come again rejoicing, bringing
his sheaves with him.</p>

<p>"Gather the wheat into my barn;" then Satan's
policy will be unsuccessful. The enemy came and
sowed tares among the wheat, hopeful that the false
wheat would destroy or materially injure the true; but
he failed in the end, for the wheat ripened and was
ready to be gathered. Christ's garner shall be filled;
the tares shall not choke the wheat. The evil one will
be put to shame.</p>

<p>In gathering in the wheat, good angels will be employed:
"the angels are the reapers." This casts
special scorn upon the great evil angel. He sows the
tares, and tries to destroy the harvest; and therefore
the good angels are brought in to celebrate his defeat,
and to rejoice together with their Lord in the success of
the divine husbandry. Satan will make a poor profit
out of his meddling; he shall be baulked in all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
efforts, and so the threat shall be fulfilled, "Upon thy
belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat."</p>

<p>By giving the angels work to do, all intelligent
creatures, of whose existence we have information, are
made to take an interest in the work of grace; whether
for malice or for adoration, redemption excites them
all. To all, the wonderful works of God are made
manifest; for these things were not done in a corner.</p>

<p>We too much forget the angels. Let us not overlook
their tender sympathy with us; they behold the Lord rejoicing
over our repentance, and they rejoice with him;
they are our watchers and the Lord's messengers of
mercy; they bear us up in their hands lest we dash our
foot against a stone; and when we come to die, they
carry us to the bosom of our Lord. It is one of our joys
that we have come to an innumerable company of
angels; let us think of them with affection.</p>

<p>At this time I will keep to my text, and preach from
it almost word by word. It begins with "but," and
that is <span class="smcap">a word of separation</span>.</p>

<p>Here note that the tares and the wheat will grow
together until the time of harvest shall come. It is a
great sorrow of heart to some of the wheat to be growing
side by side with tares. The ungodly are as thorns
and briers to those who fear the Lord. How frequently
is the sigh forced forth from the godly heart: "Woe
is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
of Kedar!" A man's foes are often found within his
own household; those who should have been his best
helpers are often his worst hinderers; their conversation
vexes and torments him. It is of little use to try to
escape from them, for the tares are permitted in God's
providence to grow with the wheat, and they will do so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
until the end. Good men have emigrated to distant
lands to found communities in which there should be
none but saints, and, alas! sinners have sprung up in
their own families. The attempt to weed the ungodly
and heretical out of the settlement has led to persecution
and other evils, and the whole plan has proved a failure.
Others have shut themselves away in hermitages
to avoid the temptations of the world, and so have
hoped to win the victory by running away; this is not
the way of wisdom. The word for this present is,
"Let both grow together;" <i>but</i> there will come a time
when a final separation will be made. Then, dear
Christian woman, your husband will never persecute
you again. Godly sister, your brother will heap no
more ridicule upon you. Pious workman, there will be
no more jesting and taunting from the ungodly. That
"but" will be an iron gate between the god-fearing
and the godless; then will the tares be cast into the
fire, <i>but</i> the Lord of the harvest will say, "Gather the
wheat into my barn."</p>

<p>This separation must be made; for the growing of
the wheat and the tares together on earth has caused
much pain and injury, and therefore it will not be continued
in a happier world. We can very well suppose
that godly men and women might be willing that their
unconverted children should dwell with them in heaven;
but it cannot be, for God will not have his cleansed
ones defiled nor his glorified ones tried by the presence
of the unbelieving. The tares must be taken away in
order to the perfectness and usefulness of the wheat.
Would you have the tares and the wheat heaped up together
in the granary in one mass? That would be ill
husbandry with a vengeance. They can neither of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
them be put to appropriate use till thoroughly separated.
Even so, mark you, the saved and the unsaved may live
together here, but they must not live together in another
world. The command is absolute: "Gather the tares,
and bind them in bundles to burn them: <i>but</i> gather the
wheat into my barn." Sinner, can you hope to enter
heaven? You never loved your mother's God, and is
he to endure you in his heavenly courts? You never
trusted your father's Saviour, and yet are you to behold
his glory for ever? Are you to go swaggering down
the streets of heaven, letting fall an oath, or singing a
loose song? Why, you know, you get tired of the
worship of God on the Lord's day; do you think that
the Lord will endure unwilling worshippers in the temple
above? The Sabbath is a wearisome day to you;
how can you hope to enter into the Sabbath of God?
You have no taste for heavenly pursuits, and these
things would be profaned if you were permitted to partake
in them; therefore that word "but" must come
in, and you must part from the Lord's people never to
meet again. Can you bear to think of being divided
from godly friends for ever and ever?</p>

<p>That separation involves an awful difference of destiny.
"Gather the tares in bundles to burn them." I
do not dare to draw the picture; but when the bundle
is bound up there is no place for it except the fire. God
grant that you may never know all the anguish which
burning must mean; but may you escape from it at
once. It is no trifle which the Lord of love compares to
being consumed with fire. I am quite certain that no
words of mine can ever set forth its terror. They say that
we speak dreadful things about the wrath to come; but
I am sure that we understate the case. What must the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
tender, loving, gracious Jesus have meant by the words,
"Gather the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn
them?" See what a wide distinction between the lot
of the Lord's people and Satan's people. Burn the
wheat? Oh, no; "Gather the wheat into my barn."
There let them be happily, safely housed for ever. Oh,
the infinite distance between heaven and hell!&mdash;the
harps and the angels, and the wailing and gnashing of
teeth! Who can ever measure the width of that gulf
which divides the glorified saint, white-robed and
crowned with immortality, from the soul which is driven
forever away from the presence of God, and from the
glory of his power? It is a dreadful "but"&mdash;that
"but" of separation. I pray you, remember that it
will interpose between brother and brother&mdash;between
mother and child&mdash;between husband and wife. "One
shall be taken and the other left." And when that
sword shall descend to divide, there shall never be
any after union. The separation is eternal. There is
no hope or possibility of change in the world to come.</p>

<p>But, says one, "that dreadful '<i>but</i>'! Why must
there be such a difference?" The answer is, Because
there always was a difference. The wheat was sown by
the Son of man; the false wheat was sown by the
enemy. There was always a difference in character&mdash;the
wheat was good, the tares were evil. This difference
did not appear at first, but it became more and more
apparent as the wheat ripened, and as the tares ripened
too. They were totally different plants; and so a regenerate
person and an unregenerate person are altogether
different beings. I have heard an unregenerate
man say that he is quite as good as the godly man; but
in so boasting he betrayed his pride. Surely there is as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
great a difference in God's sight between the unsaved
and the believer as between darkness and light, or between
the dead and the living. There is in the one a life
which there is not in the other, and the difference is
vital and radical. Oh, that you may never trifle with
this essential matter, but be really the wheat of the
Lord! It is vain to have the name of wheat, we must
have the nature of wheat. God will not be mocked;
he will not be pleased by our calling ourselves Christians
while we are not so. Be not satisfied with church
membership; but seek after membership with Christ.
Do not talk about faith, but exercise it. Do not boast
of experience, but possess it. Be not <i>like</i> the wheat,
but be the wheat. No shams and imitations will stand
in the last great day; that terrible "but" will roll as
a sea of fire between the true and the false. Oh Holy
Spirit! let each of us be found transformed by thy power.</p>


<p class="p2">II. The second word of our text is "gather"&mdash;that
is <span class="smcap">a word of congregation</span>. What a blessed thing
this gathering is! I feel it a great pleasure to gather
multitudes together to hear the gospel; and is it not a
joy to see a house full of people, on week-days and Sabbath-days,
who are willing to leave their homes and to
come considerable distances to listen to the gospel? It
is a great thing to gather people together for that;
but the gathering of the wheat into the barn is a far
more wonderful business. Gathering is in itself better
than scattering, and I pray that the Lord Jesus may
ever exercise his attracting power in this place; for he
is no Divider, but "unto him shall the gathering of the
people be." Has he not said, "I, if I be lifted up from
the earth, will draw all men unto me"?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Observe, that the congregation mentioned in our
text is selected and assembled by skilled gatherers:
"The angels are the reapers." Ministers could not do
it, for they do not know all the Lord's wheat, and they
are apt to make mistakes&mdash;some by too great leniency,
and others by excessive severity. Our poor judgments
occasionally shut out saints, and often shut in sinners.
The angels will know their Master's property. They
know each saint, for they were present at his birthday.
Angels know when sinners repent, and they never forget
the persons of the penitents. They have witnessed
the lives of those who have believed, and have helped
them in their spiritual battles, and so they know them.
Yes, angels by a holy instinct discern the Father's children,
and are not to be deceived. They will not fail to
gather all the wheat and to leave out every tare.</p>

<p>But they are gathered under a very stringent regulation;
for, first of all, according to the parable, the
tares, the false wheat, have been taken out, and then
the angelic reapers gather nothing but the wheat. The
seed of the serpent, fathered by Satan, is thus separated
from the seed of the kingdom, owned by Jesus, the promised
deliverer. This is the one distinction; and no
other is taken into consideration. If the most amiable
unconverted persons could stand in the ranks with the
saints, the angels would not bear them to heaven, for
the mandate is, "Gather the wheat." Could the most
honest man be found standing in the centre of the
church, with all the members round about him, and
with all the ministers entreating that he might be
spared, yet if he were not a believer he could not be
carried into the divine garner. There is no help for it.
The angels have no choice in the matter; the peremp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>tory
command is, "Gather <i>the wheat</i>," and they must
gather none else.</p>

<p>It will be a gathering from very great distances.
Some of the wheat ripens in the South Sea Islands, in
China, and in Japan. Some flourishes in France, broad
acres grow in the United States; there is scarce a land
without a portion of the good grain. Where all God's
wheat grows I cannot tell. There is a remnant, according
to the election of grace, among every nation and
people; but the angels will gather all the good grain
to the same garner.</p>

<p>"Gather the wheat." The saints will be found in
all ranks of society. The angels will bring in a few
ears from palaces, and great armfuls from cottages!
Many will be collected from the lowly cottages of our
villages and hamlets, and others will be upraised from
the back slums of our great cities to the metropolis of
God. From the darkest places angels will bring those
children of sweetness and light who seldom beheld the
sun, and yet were pure in heart and saw their God.
The hidden and obscure shall be brought into the light,
for the Lord knoweth them that are his, and his harvestmen
will not miss them.</p>

<p>To me it is a charming thought that they will come
from all the ages. Let us hope that our first father
Adam will be there, and mother Eve, following in the
footsteps of their dear son Abel, and trusting in the
same sacrifice. We shall meet Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, and Moses, and David, and Daniel, and all the
saints made perfect. What a joy to see the apostles,
martyrs, and reformers! I long to see Luther, and
Calvin, and Bunyan, and Whitefield. I like the rhyme
of good old father Ryland:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line small">"They all shall be there, the great and the small,</div>
<div class="line small ip5">Poor I shall shake hands with the blessed St. Paul."</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>I do not know how that will be, but I have not much
doubt that we shall have fellowship with all the saints
of every age in the general assembly and church of the
firstborn, whose names are written in heaven.</p>

<p>No matter when or where the wheat grew, it shall
be gathered into the one barn; gathered never to be
scattered; gathered out of all divisions of the visible
church, never to be divided again. They grew in different
fields. Some flourished on the hillside where Episcopalians
grow in all their glory, and others in the
lowlier soil, where Baptists multiply, and Methodists
flourish; but once the wheat is in the barn none can
tell in which field the ears grew. Then, indeed, shall
the Master's prayer have a glorious answer&mdash;"That
they all may be one." All our errors removed and our
mistakes corrected and forgiven, the one Lord, the one
faith, and the one baptism will be known of us all, and
there will be no more vexings and envyings. What a
blessed gathering it will be! What a meeting! The
elect of God, the <i>élite</i> of all the centuries, of whom the
world was not worthy. I should not like to be away.
If there were no hell, it would be hell enough to me to
be shut out of such heavenly society. If there were no
weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, it would be
dreadful enough to miss the presence of the Lord, and
the joy of praising him forever, and the bliss of meeting
with all the noblest beings that ever lived. Amid
the needful controversies of the age, I, who have been
doomed to seem a man of strife, sigh for the blessed
rest wherein all spiritual minds shall blend in eternal
accord before the throne of God and of the Lamb. Oh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
that we were all right, that we might be all happily
united in one spirit!</p>


<p class="p2">In the text there is next <span class="smcap">a word of designation</span>.
I have already trespassed upon that domain. "Gather
<i>the wheat</i>." Nothing but "the wheat" must be placed
in the Lord's homestead. Lend me your hearts while
I urge you to a searching examination for a minute
or two. The wheat was sown of the Lord. Are you
sown of the Lord? Friend, if you have any religion,
how did you get it? Was it self-sown? If so, it is
good for nothing. The true wheat was sown by the Son
of man. Are you sown of the Lord? Did the Spirit of
God drop eternal life into your bosom? Did it come
from that dear hand which was nailed to the cross? Is
Jesus your life? Does your life begin and end with
him? If so, it is well.</p>

<p>The wheat sown of the Lord is also the object of
the Lord's care. Wheat needs a deal of attention. The
farmer would get nothing from it if he did not watch it
carefully. Are you under the Lord's care? Does he
keep you? Is that word true to your soul, "I the Lord
do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt
it, I will keep it night and day?" Do you experience
such keeping? Make an honest answer, as you love
your soul.</p>

<p>Next, wheat is a useful thing, a gift from God for
the life of men. The false wheat was of no good to
anybody; it could only be eaten of swine, and then it
made them stagger like drunken men. Are you one of
those who are wholesome in society&mdash;who are like bread
to the world, so that if men receive you and your example
and your teaching they will be blessed thereby?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Judge yourselves whether ye are good or evil in life and
influence.</p>

<p>"Gather the wheat." You know that God must
put the goodness, the grace, the solidity, and the usefulness
into you, or else you will never be wheat fit for
angelic gathering. One thing is true of the wheat&mdash;that
it is the most dependent of all plants. I have
never heard of a field of wheat which sprang up, and
grew, and ripened without a husbandman's care. Some
ears may appear after a harvest when the corn has
shaled out; but I have never heard of plains in America
or elsewhere covered with unsown wheat. No, no.
There is no wheat where there is no man, and there is
no grace where there is no Christ. We owe our very
existence to the Father, who is the husbandman.</p>

<p>Yet, dependent as it is, wheat stands in the front
rank of honor and esteem; and so do the godly in the
judgment of all who are of understanding heart. We
are nothing without Christ; but with him we are full
of honor. Oh, to be among those by whom the world
is preserved, the excellent of the earth in whom the
saints delight; God forbid we should be among the
base and worthless tares!</p>


<p class="p2">Our last head, upon which also I will speak briefly,
is <span class="smcap">a word of destination</span>. "Gather the wheat <i>into my
barn</i>." The process of gathering in the wheat will be
completed at the day of judgment, but it is going on
every day. From hour to hour saints are gathered;
they are going heavenward even now. I am so glad to
hear as a regular thing that the departed ones from my
own dear church have such joy in being harvested.
Glory be to God, our people die well. The best thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
is to live well, but we are greatly gladdened to hear
that the brethren die well; for, full often, that is the
most telling witness for vital godliness. Men of the
world feel the power of triumphant deaths.</p>

<p>Every hour the saints are being gathered into the
barn. That is where they want to be. We feel no pain
at the news of ingathering, for we wish to be safely
stored up by our Lord. If the wheat that is in the field
could speak, every ear would say, "The ultimatum for
which we are living and growing is the barn, the granary."
For this the frosty night; for this the sunny
day; for this the dew and the rain; and for this everything.
Every process with the wheat is tending toward
the granary. So is it with us; everything is
working toward heaven&mdash;toward the gathering place&mdash;toward
the congregation of the righteous&mdash;toward
the vision of our Redeemer's face. Our death will
cause no jar in our life-music; it will involve no pause
or even discord; it is part of a programme, the crowning
of our whole history.</p>

<p>To the wheat the barn is the place of security. It
dreads no mildew there; it fears no frost, no heat, no
drought, no wet, when once in the barn. All its
growth-perils are past. It has reached its perfection.
It has rewarded the labor of the husbandman, and it is
housed. Oh, long-expected day, begin! Oh, brethren,
what a blessing it will be when you and I shall have
come to our maturity, and Christ shall see in us the
travail of his soul.</p>

<p>I delight to think of heaven as <i>his</i> barn; <i>his</i> barn,
what must that be? It is but the poverty of language
that such an expression has to be used at all concerning
the home of our Father, the dwelling of Jesus. Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
is the palace of the King, but, so far, to us a barn, because
it is the place of security, the place of rest for
ever. It is the homestead of Christ to which we shall
be carried, and for this we are ripening. It is to be
thought of with ecstatic joy; for the gathering into the
barn involves a harvest home, and I have never heard
of men sitting down to cry over an earthly harvest
home, nor of their following the sheaves with tears.
Nay, they clap their hands, they dance for joy, and
shout right lustily. Let us do something like that concerning
those who are already housed. With grave,
sweet melodies let us sing around their tombs. Let us
feel that, surely, the bitterness of death is passed.
When we remember their glory, we may rejoice like the
travailing woman when her child is born, who "remembereth
no more the anguish, for joy that a man is
born into the world." Another soul begins to sing in
heaven; why do you weep, O heirs of immortality? Is
the eternal happiness of the righteous the birth which
comes of their death-pangs? Then happy are they who
die. Is glory the end and outcome of that which fills
our home with mourning? If so, thank God for bereavements;
thank God for saddest severings. He has
promoted our dear ones to the skies! He has blessed
them beyond all that we could ask or even think; he
has taken them out of this weary world to lie in his own
bosom for ever. Blessed be his name if it were for
nothing else but this. Would you keep your old father
here, full of pain, and broken down with feebleness?
Would you shut him out of glory? Would you detain
your dear wife here with all her suffering? Would you
hold back your husband from the crown immortal?
Could you wish your child to descend to earth again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
from the bliss which now surrounds her? No, no. We
wish to be going home ourselves to the heavenly
Father's house and its many mansions; but concerning
the departed we rejoice before the Lord as with the joy
of harvest. "Wherefore comfort one another with
these words."</p>

<p class="p2 xlarge center">The Ethics of Marriage.</p>

<p class="center large">BY H. S. POMEROY, M.D.</p>

<p>Prefatory note by Thomas Addis Emmett, M.D., LL.D., and
Introduction by Rev. J. T. Duryea, D.D., of Boston. With an
appendix showing the laws of most of the States and Territories
regarding certain forms of crime. 12mo, cloth, 190 pp. Price,
$1.00.</p>

<p class="p2">The Author says in the preface:</p>

<p>"The matters here treated have been on my heart for many years. Heart-sickening
facts have come to my notice within the past few months, and I feel it my
duty to send out this warning in regard to what I consider the first and greatest
danger of our family and national life. I believe the prevention or destruction of
unborn human life to be, par-excellence, the American sin, and that, if not checked,
it will sooner or later be our calamity. This sin has its roots in a low and false idea
of marriage on the part of some, and in others it is fostered by false standards of
modesty."</p>

<p class="p2">Chicago Journal says:</p>

<p>"To the earnest man and woman everywhere, who has watched the reckless manner
in which marriages are contracted, the wicked way in which the responsibilities
are shifted and ignored, and the slow and sure defilement of society because the
criminal classes are allowed to propagate their vile species, while Christian households
and moral parents ignore their duty to this and to the next world, this book is
almost like a voice from heaven."</p>


<p class="p2 center xlarge">A Man's Will.</p>

<p class="center large">BY EDGAR FAWCETT.</p>

<p>It presents pictures of New York life and shows the terribly degrading
effects of drunkenness in the upper ranks of society. A temperance
novel of surprising interest. 12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p class="p2">The New York Press says:</p>

<p>"The best temperance story published in many years, if indeed its equal exists.
The author, evidently conscious that his subject is one on which too much cannot be
said, and well aware that the sufferings of alcoholic victims and all connected with
them, are beyond description, has grappled with his work in deadly earnest. Old
and young people ought to read and ponder over this good and brilliantly prepared
study.</p>

Second edition. Paper, 20 cents; board, 30 cents. Special rates

<p>"These bells are not muffled; they give out no uncertain sound. The fifty-two
notes are clear, high, piercing, pulse-quickening, soul-uplifting; yet to the old parties,
doubtless, very discordant. They will be heard throughout the land, for they call
to better, purer living, both by the individual and the State. The book cannot but
be a <i>vade-mecum</i> to every Prohibitionist organization, be it large or small, for a
song often wins a vote when an oration fails; and then how tame is a campaign
without music!"</p>
